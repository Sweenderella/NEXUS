Physical effects refer to emission inventories, fuel consumption, oil imports, vehicle miles traveled including effects associated with the rebound effect, and safety effects. The cost and benefits of the proposal are tied directly to these physical effects and are discussed in Chapter 10 of this draft RIA."

Any AEO can be used provided the input files are made available to OMEGA. For this analysis, EPA has used AEO 2021. (U.S. EIA 2021) AEO 2021 was done assuming that the future fleet would comply with the 2020 SAFE FRM. Hence, when running OMEGA, the first scenario run is best meant to reflect the SAFE FRM standards. That way, future fleet VMT and rebound VMT will be calculated relative to that projected future, as described below."

                "content": " OMEGA uses as a \"base year fleet\" a comprehensive list of vehicles sold in a recent model year. This base year fleet includes all models of vehicles, their sales, and a long list of attributes such as their curb weights, their footprints and the primary GHG technologies on those vehicles. For this analysis, EPA is using the MY 2019 fleet as the base year fleet. When OMEGA runs, it begins with the 2020 calendar year as the first year of the analysis and uses the fleet of vehicles contained in the base year fleet as the starting point for the analysis. These MY 2020 and later vehicles are referred to as the \"analysis fleet.\" Vehicles that exist in the fleet prior to the first year of the analysis (i.e., MY 2020) are referred to as the \"legacy fleet.\" Those vehicles are \"aged out\" of the fleet over the course of running the analysis. The legacy fleet vehicles are not changed in any way within OMEGA other than being scrapped (aging out) and driving fewer miles per year. Figure 9-1 shows ICE vehicle stock--liquid-fueled vehicles including HEVs--and Figure 9-2 shows BEV stock. The ICE vehicle stock can be seen to be aging out of the fleet as the BEV stock grows. Figure 9-3 shows the total vehicle stock with growth representing economic and population growth going forward. 300,000,000 100,000,000 50,000,000 0 2027 2029 2031 2033 2035 2037 2039 2041 2043 2045 2047 2049 2051 2053 2055 Figure 9-1 ICE vehicle stock used in OMEGA effects calculations 200,000,000 180,000,000 150,000,000 200,000,000 250,000,000 No Action Alternative 2 Alternative 3 Proposal Alternative 1 160,000,000 140,000,000 120,000,000 100,000,000 80,000,000 60,000,000 40,000,000 20,000,000 Alternative 1 Proposal Alternative 3 Alternative 2 No Action 0 2027 2029 2031 2033 2035 2037 2039 2041 2043 2045 2047 2049 2051 2053 2055 Figure 9-2 BEV stock used in OMEGA effects calculations"

To ensure that the \"context\" VMT (i.e., the total VMT of the analysis and legacy fleets) travels the number of miles projected by EIA's Annual Energy Outlook, OMEGA adjusts the VMT of every vehicle such that the total fleet VMT in any calendar year will equal that projected in AEO. This is done by determining ratio of the AEO projection for a given calendar year to that given calendar year's total VMT within OMEGA estimated using the static mileage accumulation rates shown in Table 9-1 and Table 9-2. That ratio is then applied to every vehicle's \"static\" VMT to arrive at a \"context\" VMT. This way, the fleet context VMT within OMEGA will be equivalent to the fleet VMT projected by AEO.

                "content": " The VMT rebound effect is discussed in detail in Chapter 4.2 Estimates of \"rebound\" miles driven depends, traditionally, on changing fuel prices and their effect on the number of miles people drive--as fuel prices rise and the cost per mile of driving increases, people drive less. OMEGA, we estimate the rebound effect not based on changing fuel prices, but rather on the changing cost per mile of driving for vehicles of different fuel consumption. In other words, someone that has purchased a new vehicle that consumes less fuel per mile might drive that vehicle more than if they would have continued to drive their prior vehicle that consumed more fuel per mile. As such, OMEGA's estimate of rebound VMT does not include any rebound VMT in the legacy fleet since the fuel consumption characteristics of the legacy fleet are not changing. For the analysis fleet, OMEGA first determines the fuel cost per mile for each base year fleet vehicle in every calendar year included in the analysis. This way, the base year fleet vehicle's fuel consumption characteristics are not changing through the years but its fuel costs per mile are due to changing fuel prices. These fuel costs per mile for every vehicle in the base year fleet are then used as the context fleet, or context vehicle, fuel costs per mile. In subsequent OMEGA scenarios, which include unique GHG standards that can result in unique fuel consumption characteristics for all vehicles, the fuel costs per mile for those vehicles are similarly determined. Since each vehicle in OMEGA is \"derived\" from a base year fleet vehicle, the fuel costs per mile for every vehicle can be compared to its context fuel cost per mile."

In fact, the inputs used in OMEGA are identical to inputs used by NHTSA in CCEMS and used by EPA in the 2021 light-duty GHG final rule. (86 FR 74434 2021) NHTSA is the government entity tasked with regulating vehicle safety and, as such, NHTSA has the foremost experts in the field. EPA has worked closely with NTHSA through the years of joint GHG/CAFE regulatory development and has weighed in extensively on the statistical analyses used in estimating vehicle safety effects. That said, EPA has always used modeling parameters in OMEGA that are identical to those used by NHTSA in the CCEMS. As noted, OMEGA uses vehicle travel fatality rates and safety values associated with mass reduction that have been generated by NHTSA. These fatality rates and safety values and how they are generated are described at length in the regulatory documents supporting NHTSA\u2019s 2022 CAFE final rule. (2022 CAFE FRIA 2022) (2022 CAFE TSD 2022) The discussion here does not attempt to provide that same level of detail and is meant only to summarize the NHTSA analysis to help in understanding the input values used in OMEGA. The safety analysis is meant to capture effects associated with three factors: \u2022 Changes in vehicle mass or weight; \u2022 Changes associated with fleet composition including car, CUV, SUV, pickup shares and fleet turnover; and, \u2022 The potential for additional safety impacts associated with additional driving (i.e., the \u201crebound effect\u201d as mentioned in Chapter 9.3.3) that might arise from lower fuel costs resulting from more stringent GHG standards. In the following, we first cover the base fatality rates of vehicles in the legacy fleet.. We then cover the changes to those fatality rates associated with changes in vehicle mass and changes in the analysis fleet composition. We then summarize the calculation approach to estimating fatalities within OMEGA and present results."

                "content": " To estimate the impact of the standards on safety, NHTSA uses statistical models that explicitly incorporate variation in the safety performance of individual vehicle model years. They use a model for fatalities that tracks vehicles from when they are produced and sold, enter the fleet, gradually age and are ultimately retired from service. NHTSA also considers how newer technologies are likely to affect the safety of both individual vehicles and the combined fleet. The overall safety of the light-duty vehicle fleet during any future calendar year is determined by the safety performance of the individual model year cohorts comprising it at the ages they will have reached during that year, the representation of each model year cohort in that (calendar) year\u2019s fleet, and a host of external factors that fluctuate over time, such as driver demographics and behavior, economic conditions, traffic levels, and emergency response and medical care. Combining forecasts of future crash rates for individual model year cohorts at different ages with the composition of the vehicle fleet produces baseline forecasts of fatalities. Regulatory alternatives that establish new standards for future model years can change these forecasts by altering the representation of different model year cohorts making up the future light-duty fleet (2022 CAFE FRIA 2022). NHTSA\u2019s work produces estimates of fatality rates for each model year making up the fleet during each future calendar year, and the process is continued until calendar year 2050. Multiplying these rates by the estimated number of miles driven by vehicles of each model year in use during a future calendar year produces baseline estimates of total fatalities. As an example, Figure 9-3 illustrates the recent history and baseline forecast of the overall fatality rate for occupants of cars and light trucks. According to NHTSA, the sharp rise in the fatality rate for 2020 coincided with the steep drop in car and light truck VMT during that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying restrictions on activity, combined with an increased number of fatalities in 2020. These rates are also used as the basis for estimating future fatalities and for estimating changes in safety resulting from reductions in the mass of new vehicles, additional rebound-effect driving, and changes in the numbers of cars and light trucks from different model years making up each calendar year\u2019s fleet. The underlying causes and methods for estimating each of those three sources of changes in safety are discussed in detail in various sub-sections of Chapter 7 of the Technical Support Document (TSD) accompanying NHTSA\u2019s 2022 final rule (2022 CAFE TSD 2022).

                "content": " To calculate the safety effects associated with changes to vehicle weight, OMEGA makes use of fatality rate changes per billion miles of vehicle travel associated with vehicles of different body styles\u2014as with base fatality rates these are developed by NHTSA\u2014and weight changes determined within OMEGA as vehicles change to meet future GHG standards. The first of these factors are, as noted, developed by NHTSA through an analytical process that is detailed in their 2022 final RIA and TSD (2022 CAFE FRIA 2022) (2022 CAFE TSD 2022). OMEGA makes use of the input parameters used by NHTSA in CCEMS model runs supporting their 2022 final rule. Those values are shown in Table 9-4. Table 9-5 Safety values used in OMEGA (2022 CAFE FRIA 2022) Body style NHTSA Safety Class Threshold (lbs) Change per 100 lbs below threshold Change per 100 lbs at or above threshold sedan PC 3201 0.012 0.0042 pickup LT/SUV 5014 0.0031 -0.0061 cuv_suv CUV/Minivan 3872 -0.0025 -0.0025 For example, the base fatality rate for a pickup would change by -0.0061 for every 100 pounds of weight reduced over 5,014 pounds. However, if that vehicle had a starting weight of 5,064 pounds and its weight was reduced by 100 pounds, then the first 50 of those pounds would reduce the base fatality rate by -0.00305 (-0.0061 per 100 pounds but for only 50 pounds) and the next 50 pounds would increase the base fatality rate by 0.00155 (0.0031 per 100 pounds but for only 50 pounds). In other words, reducing pickup weight above 5,014 pounds reduces fatalities while reducing pickup weight below 5,104 increases fatalities. In contrast, increasing pickup weight above 5,014 pounds increases fatalities while increasing pickup weight below 5,014 pounds reduces fatalities. Therefore, OMEGA first determines the weight change of the given vehicle. This is calculated as the curb weight of the vehicle in the policy scenario (i.e., the final weight) relative to the curb weight of the vehicle in the base year fleet. \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u210e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u210e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u210e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36 Where, DeltaWeight = the change in weight, where a weight reduction will be a negative value FinalWeight = the weight of the vehicle in the policy scenario BaseYearWeight = the weight of the vehicle in the base year fleet Knowing the delta weight, OMEGA then determines the weight change above and below the threshold for the body style of the given vehicle. Importantly, because OMEGA sometimes increases the curb weight of vehicles (e.g., due to conversion to BEV), whether the weight change is positive (increased weight) or negative (decreased weight) is important given the safety values and their signs as shown in Table 9-4. To determine the pounds changed below the threshold, and whether they involve increased or decreased weight, OMEGA uses the logic shown below: If: Threshold < BaseWeight and Threshold < FinalWeight: Then: DeltaPoundsbelow = 0 Else if: BaseWeight < Threshold and FinalWeight < Threshold: Then: DeltaPoundsbelow = FinalWeight - BaseWeight Else if: BaseWeight < Threshold < FinalWeight: Then: DeltaPoundsbelow = Threshold - BaseWeight Else if: FinalWeight < Threshold < BaseWeight: Then: DeltaPoundsbelow = FinalWeight - Threshold To determine the pounds changed above the threshold, and whether they involve increased or decreased weight, OMEGA uses the logic shown below: If: BaseWeight < Threshold and FinalWeight < Threshold Then: DeltaPoundsabove = 0 Else if: Threshold <= BaseWeight and Threshold <= FinalWeight Then: DeltaPoundsabove = FinalWeight - BaseWeight Else if: BaseWeight <= Threshold <= FinalWeight: Then: DeltaPoundsabove = FinalWeight - Threshold Else if: FinalWeight <= Threshold <= BaseWeight: Then: DeltaPoundsabove = Threshold - BaseWeight With the weight change above and below the threshold, OMEGA calculates the fatality rate changes as shown below: \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51100\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64 \u00d7 (\u2212\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 = \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51100\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \u00d7 (\u2212\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52) Where, RateChange = the change in fatality rate below/above the weight threshold for the given body style as shown in Table 9-4; the base fatality rate that is changed by this rate change is discussed in the next section.

                "content": " To develop a best mix of regulatory cycles representing typical onroad vehicle operation, EPA used two sources: the MOVES light-duty drive cycles and associated weights, and aggregate vehicle behavior gleaned from California Real Emissions Assessment Logging (REAL) data. The MOVES model uses 18 representative cycles. For each cycle, the time, distance, and energy expenditure at each speed was calculated, then binned in 0.5 mph increments. Additionally, the average speed and positive kinetic energy (\"PKE;\" a measure of driver aggressiveness) was calculated. The energy expenditure was calculated using the equivalent test weight (ETW) and road load of a nominal vehicle. Nominal vehicle characteristics were determined using the MOVES average passenger car and light truck parameters, weighted by vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The statistics for all cycles were combined and weighted based on the VMT associated with each cycle. The end result indicated an average speed of 36.6 mph and a PKE of 3700 km/hr2. From the California REAL data, the average vehicle speed and positive kinetic energy was determined across a range of vehicles. These data indicated an average speed higher than that from the MOVES model data (41.1 mph), but a similar PKE (3900 km/hr2). To represent onroad behavior, EPA began with the energy expenditure distribution from the MOVES data, as shown in Figure 9-8. The MOVES energy expenditure distribution is shown compared to the energy expenditure distribution of the \"city\" (FTP) and highway (HW) cycles, weighted 55%/45%. As can be seen, the 55/45 FTP/HW cycle has peak energy expenditure at a noticeably lower MJ/mile value, leading to a substantially lower cumulative energy expenditure. (The small peaks in the 55/45 FTP/HW cycle correspond to accelerations of positive and negative 3.3 mph/sec, accelerations at which these cycles are truncated.) Figure 9-4 Energy distribution (top) and cumulative energy use (bottom) over 10,000 miles for the MOVES onroad data, compared to FTP/HW regulatory cycles, weighted 55%/45%. To develop a better mix of cycles to represent onroad operation, EPA looked primarily at the energy distribution, but also factored in the distribution of speeds and the PKE. At the end, a mix of cycles was chosen that best matched these multiple optimization criteria. EPA evaluated reweighting the bags of the FTP, and incorporating portions of the US06 cycle. Reweighting the FTP did not improve the energy distribution match between vehicle operation across cycles and representative onroad operation used to estimate energy use and fuel consumption. However, incorporating the high acceleration and high-speed portions of the US06 did improve the energy distribution match with the MOVES data. Moreover, with the inclusion of the US06 cycle, incorporating the HW cycle conferred no benefit, and this cycle was dropped. After considering the effects of various cycle mixes, EPA selected a mix of cycles where the weighting was 27% FTP, 6% US06 bag 1 (a high acceleration \"city\" bag), and 67% US06 bag 2 (a high speed \"highway\" bag). The energy expenditure distribution for this new cycle mix is shown in Figure 9-9, again compared to the MOVES data. As can be seen, the energy distribution of this cycle mix is much better aligned with the MOVES data, and the total positive energy expended is nearly identical. Figure 9-5 Energy distribution (top) and cumulative energy use (bottom) over 10,000 miles for the new cycle mix (27% FTP, 6% US06 bag 1, 67% US06 bag 2) compared to the MOVES onroad data. In choosing this new cycle mix, EPA also considered the speed distribution of the mix and the PKE. This mix of cycles had a PKE of 4300 km/hr2 (slightly higher than the MOVES or REAL data) and an average speed of 40.6 mph. This average speed is higher than that of the MOVES data, and closer to (but lower than) the REAL data. The speed distribution for this mix is shown in Figure 9-10. As can be inferred from Figure 9-10, the FTP and US06 cycles have substantial periods of operation within a small speed window, giving the speed distribution the clear double-humped shape. However, the overall speed profile remains similar that from the MOVES data. Figure 9-6 Speed distribution for the new cycle mix (27% FTP, 6% US06 bag 1, 67% US06 bag 2) compared to the MOVES onroad data. To estimate fuel consumption impacts, OMEGA considers both the fuel(s) used by a given vehicle and the share of miles driven by the vehicle on that fuel or fuels. For a fossil fuel-only vehicle (including HEVs) or a BEV, the share of miles driven on the primary fuel would be 100 percent. For a PHEV, the share of miles driven on each fuel, the primary fuel (presumably liquid fuel), and the secondary fuel (presumably electricity), are considered. First, the vehicle miles traveled for the given vehicle on each fuel is calculated as below. \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u210e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52;\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54 = \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u210e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52 \u00d7 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f Where, VMTvehicle;fuel = the VMT of the vehicle on a given fuel VMTvehicle = the VMT of the vehicle FuelShare = the share of miles driven on a given fuel"

                "content": " To estimate emission inventory effects due to a potential policy, OMEGA uses, as inputs, a set of vehicle and electricity generating unit (EGU) emission rates. In a circular process, we first generate emission inventories using very detailed emissions models that estimate inventories from vehicles (EPA's MOVES model) and EGUs (EPA\u2019s Power Sector Modeling Platform, v.6.21 ). The generation of those inventories is described in Chapter 8 and Chapter 5, respectively. However, upstream inventories (EGUs) made use of a set of bounding runs that l ooked at two possible futures--one with a low level of fleet electrification and another with a higher level of electrification. These bounding runs represented our best estimate of these two possible futures--the continuation of the 2021 FRM (lower) and our proposal (upper)--at the time that those model runs were conducted. With those bounded sets of inventories, and the associated fuel demands within them (i.e., electricity demands for EGUs), we can calculate emission rates for the two ends of these bounds. Using those rates, we can interpolate, using the given OMEGA policy scenario's fuel demands, to generate a unique set of emission rates for that OMEGA policy scenario. Using those unique rates, OMEGA then generates emission inventories for any future OMEGA policy scenario depending on the liquid fuel and electricity demands of that specific policy. For vehicle emissions, EPA made use of two sets of MOVES emission inventory runs--one assuming no future use of gasoline particulate filters and one assuming such use. Using the miles traveled (for tailpipe, tire wear and brake wear emissions) and liquid fuel consumed (for evaporative and fuel spillage emissions), we can then generate sets of emission rates for use in OMEGA. Using those rates, which are specific to fuel types and vehicle types (car vs. truck, etc.), we can then generate unique emission inventories for the given OMEGA policy scenario. This is important given the changing nature of the transportation fleet (BEV vs ICE, car vs CUV vs pickup) and the way those change for any possible policy scenario and the many factors within that impact the future fleet composition and the very different vehicle emission rates for BEV vs ICE vehicles. This is especially true given the consumer choice elements within OMEGA and the wide variety of input parameters that can have significant impacts on the projected future fleet."

Those inventories are presented in Tables 5-2 and 5-3 and are shown graphically in the accompanying charts. To generate those inventories, EPA first ran OMEGA to estimate PEV energy demands into the future. Those energy demands were used in the modeling of EGU inventories presented in Chapter 5. EPA then uses the resultant inventories along with the associated \"Generation\" values shown in Tables 5-2 and 5-3, appropriately, and the estimated PEV energy demands from OMEGA used in generating the EGU inventory results, to generate a set of curves as a function of years from 2020.

To estimate the unique EGU emission rates for any given OMEGA scenario, OMEGA first determines the PEV consumption estimate for a given year, which is driven by the level of the standards and the expected PEV penetration rate, among other impacts (consumer acceptance, critical materials, etc.).

That result is then used as a new US generation value, unique to the given OMEGA scenario. \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 + \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a OMEGA then calculates the EGU emission rate for each pollutant in the low PEV (2021 FRM) case and the high PEV (proposal) scenarios, both of which are calculated using the rate curves shown in Table 9-12.

Table 9-13 Refinery emissions in AQM inventories in 2055 Pollutant 2016 (tons/year) Reference Scenario (tons/yr) LMDV Regulatory Scenario (tons/yr) PM2.5 78,332 18,855 18,468 NOX 19,958 67,470 66,067 SO2 30,065 28,851 28,281 VOC 67,853 56,946 55,876 Using AEO 2021, Table 11, we estimated that the U.S. produced 194 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel in calendar year 2021 which represented 64 percent of the refined products produced by U.S. refineries, the rest being liquified petroleum gas, jet fuel, home heating oil and other. Using these 2021 gallons and attributing them to the 2016 inventories (in the absence of 2016 gallons or 2021 inventories), we arrived at 2016 refinery emission rates as shown in Table 9-14 (e.g., for PM2.5, 78,332 tons/year x 907185 grams/ton divided by 194 billion gallons divided by 0.64 gasoline and diesel share = 0.578 grams/gallon, where rounding might result in slight differences). We followed the same procedure to estimate refinery emission rates in the LMDV regulatory scenario by dividing the tons/year shown in Table 9-13 by the estimated gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel associated with those inventories, or 131 billion gallons (see Chapter 5.1 of the Air Quality Analysis TSD). Those refinery emission rates are also shown in Table 9-14. Using the refinery emission rates shown in Table 9-14, we then calculated linear curves between the years 2016 and 2055, with years from 2016 as the independent variable, for use as inputs to OMEGA. Those refinery emission rate curves are shown in Table 9-15. Table 9-14 Refinery emission rates estimated using AQM results Pollutant 2016 (grams/gallon) LMDV Regulatory Scenario (grams/gallon) NOx 0.578 0.456 PM2.5 0.147 0.128 SOx 0.222 0.195 VOC 0.500 0.386 Table 9-15 Refinery emission rate curves used in OMEGA Pollutant Emission Rate (grams/gallon) NOx -0.00311 * (CY - 2016) + 0.578 PM2.5 -0.00050 * (CY - 2016) + 0.147 SOx -0.00068 * (CY - 2016) + 0.222 VOC -0.00294 * (CY - 2016) + 0.500 Importantly, the AQM for refineries as presented in Chapter 8 of this DRIA includes only the pollutants discussed there and briefly here. This means that we do not estimate GHG-related refinery emission impacts in OMEGA at this time. Note also that OMEGA applies a 93 percent factor to reduced liquid-fuel demand to account for the share of reduced demand resulting in reduced domestic refining of liquid fuel. In other words, 93 percent of the reduced liquid fuel demand results in reduced domestic refining. We also ran a sensitivity that assumes that reduced liquid fuel demand would have no impact on domestic refining. In that sensitivity, we would be assuming that the excess liquid fuel would be exported for use elsewhere."

                "content": " As detailed in a memo to the docket, EPA developed an updated version of MOVES3, MOVES3.R1, for use in estimating vehicle emissions for this proposal. (Beardsley 2023) To create inputs for OMEGA, EPA ran MOVES3.R1 model for two scenarios: gasoline engines with and without gasoline particulate filters (GPFs). The emission rates for these scenarios differed in that in the scenario with GPFs, the emission rates for exhaust PM were calculated by applying the GPF reduction factors described in Chapter 8 for MY 2030 and later. We ran MOVES in inventory mode to create inventory and activity output by calendar year, model year, fuel type, source type and regulatory class for brake wear, tire wear, start, running and evaporative emissions for criteria emission precursors and air toxics. In these runs, the only air toxics affected by GPFs were particle-phase PAHs, which are chained to exhaust PM in MOVES. We consolidated the PAH output to separately report emissions for naphthalene and for a potency-weighted (U.S. EPA 2021) sum of the 15 other PAHs estimated by MOVES. These two sets of MOVES output were then used to generate vehicle emission rate curves for use as OMEGA inputs. Since MOVES generates emission inventories, and the applicable miles traveled or gallons consumed attributes associated with those inventories, we can calculate nationwide vehicle emission rates from them. This is done by calculating a linear relationship between the vehicle miles traveled, or gallons consumed, and the inventory attribute. This process generates over 1,400 vehicle emission rate curves including curves for each of the pollutants and start years shown in Table 9-16 with rates for exhaust PM2.5 shown in Table 9-16 through Table 9-20 for cars, light-duty trucks, medium-duty vans and medium-duty pickups, respectively. A start year refers to the model year for which a certain set of emission rate curves would apply, until a subsequent start year becomes more appropriate and is, therefore, used instead.
