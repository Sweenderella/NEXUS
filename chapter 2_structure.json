                "content": " EPA's technical analysis supporting the proposed emissions standards, at its highest level, is based on the following major tools that are used in the assessment of emissions reduction technologies and costs. These are, in order of execution: ALPHA, response surface modeling, and OMEGA. They are used in an integrated fashion as follows: \u2022 EPA's ALPHA model is our vehicle simulation tool used to predict tailpipe CO2 emissions and energy consumption for advanced technologies. ALPHA is detailed in 2.4. \u2022 Response surface methodology (RSM) incorporates ALPHA results for various vehicle technologies over thousands of vehicle combinations into response surface equations (RSE) which can be quickly referenced to characterize any future vehicle's GHG emissions based on its size, weight, power and road loads. This approach is described in 2.4.10. \u2022 EPA's manufacturer compliance model, OMEGA, incorporates RSEs, technology costs and other inputs into its algorithms for finding cost-efficient pathways for manufacturers to achieve compliance with desired emissions standards. The compliance modeling produces a fleet of new light- and medium-duty vehicles for each analyzed model year, which OMEGA integrates into projections of the on-road vehicle stock and VMT. Finally, OMEGA tabulates the emissions inventories, physical effects, and costs and benefits that arise from the usage of vehicles over their lifetimes. A schematic of the overall analytical workflow is provided in Figure 2-1. Figure 2-1. Compliance modeling workflow. Finally, the results from OMEGA are used to inform its fleet onroad vehicle emissions model (MOVES) to generate fleet vehicle emissions and project benefits due to the proposed standards. A discussion of MOVES is provided in 8.2.1."

Like the prior releases, this latest version is intended primarily to be used as a tool to support regulatory development by providing estimates of the effects of policy alternatives under consideration. These effects include the costs associated with emissions-reducing technologies and the monetized effects normally included in a societal benefit-cost analysis, as well as physical effects that include emissions quantities, fuel consumption, and vehicle stock and usage. In developing OMEGA version 2.0 (OMEGA2), the goal was to improve modularity, transparency, and flexibility so that stakeholders can more easily review the model, conduct independent analyses, and potentially adapt the model to meet their own needs."

                "content": " EPA created OMEGA version 1.0 (OMEGA1) to analyze new GHG standards for light-duty vehicles proposed in 2011. The \u2018core\u2019 model performed the function of identifying manufacturers\u2019 cost-minimizing compliance pathways to meet a footprint-based fleet emissions standard specified by the user. A preprocessing step involved ranking the technology packages to be considered by the model based on cost-effectiveness. Postprocessing of outputs was performed separately using a spreadsheet tool, and later a scripted process which generated table summaries of modeled effects. An overview of OMEGA1 is shown on the left of Figure 2-2. In the period since the release of OMEGA1, there have been significant changes in the light duty vehicle market including technological advancements and the introduction of new mobility services. Advancements in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with greater range, faster charging capability, and expanded model availability, as well as potential synergies between BEVs, ridehailing services and autonomous driving are particularly relevant when considering pathways for greater levels of emissions reduction in the future. OMEGA2 has been developed with these trends in mind. The model\u2019s interaction between consumer and producer decisions allows a user to represent consumer responses to these new vehicles and services. The model now also has been designed to have expanded capability to model a wider range of GHG program options, which is especially important for the assessment of policies that are designed to address future GHG reduction goals. In general, with the release of OMEGA2, the goal is to improve usability and flexibility while retaining the primary functions of OMEGA1. The right side of Figure 2-2 shows the overall model flow for OMEGA2 and highlights the main areas that have been revised and updated. Figure 2-2 - Comparison of OMEGA1 and OMEGA2. Update #1: Expanded model boundaries. In defining the scope of this model version, EPA has attempted to simplify the process of conducting a run by incorporating into the model some of the pre- and post-processing steps that had previously been performed manually. At the same time, EPA recognizes that an overly expansive model boundary can result in requirements for inputs that are difficult to specify. To avoid this, the input boundary has been set only so large as to capture the elements of the system assumed are responsive to policy. This approach helps to ensure that model inputs such as technology costs and emissions rates can be quantified using data for observable, real-world, characteristics and phenomena, and in that way enable transparency by allowing the user to maintain the connection to the underlying data. For the assumptions and algorithms within the model boundary, the aim is transparency through wellorganized model code and complete documentation. Update #2: Independent Policy Module. OMEGA1 was designed to analyze a very specific GHG policy structure in which the vehicle attributes and regulatory classes used to determine emissions targets were incorporated into the code throughout the model. To make it easier to define and analyze other policy structures, the details regarding how GHG emissions targets are determined and how compliance credits are treated over time are now included in an independent Policy Module and associated policy inputs. This allows the user to incorporate new policy structures without requiring revisions to other code modules. Specifically, the producer decision module no longer contains any details specific to a GHG program structure, and instead functions only on very general program features such as fleet averaging of absolute GHG credits and required technology shares. Update #3: Modeling of multi-year strategic producer decisions. As a policy analysis tool, OMEGA is intended to model the effect of policies that may extend well into the future, beyond the timeframe of individual product cycles. OMEGA2 is structured to consider a producer objective function to be optimized over the entire analysis period. Year-by-year compliance decisions account for management of credits which can carry across years in the context of projections for technology cost and market conditions which change over time. The timeframe of a given analysis can be specified anywhere from near-term to long-term, with the length limited only by inputs and assumptions provided by the user. Update #4: Addition of a consumer response component. The light-duty vehicle market has evolved significantly in the time since the initial release of OMEGA1. As the range of available technologies and services has grown wider, so has the range of possible responses to policy alternatives. The model structure for this version includes a Consumer Module that can be used to project how the light-duty vehicle market would respond to policy-driven changes in new vehicle prices, fuel operating costs, trip fees for ride hailing services, and other consumer-facing elements. The Consumer Module outputs the estimated consumer responses, such as overall vehicle sales and sales shares, as well as vehicle re-registration and use, which together determine the stock of new and used vehicles and the associated allocation of total VMT. Update #5: Addition of feedback loops for producer decisions. OMEGA2 is structured around modeling the interactions between vehicle producers responding to a policy and consumers who own and use vehicles affected by the policy. These interactions are bi-directional, in that the producer\u2019s compliance planning and vehicle design decisions will both influence, and be influenced by, the sales and shares of vehicles demanded and the GHG credits assigned under the policy. Iterative feedback loops have now been incorporated; between the Producer and Consumer modules to ensure that modeled vehicles would be accepted by the market at the quantities and prices offered by the producer, and between the Producer and Policy modules to account for the compliance implications of each successive vehicle design and production option considered by the producer. This update has been peer reviewed as detailed in Section 2.3. Update #6: Use of absolute vehicle costs and emissions rates. OMEGA1 modeled the producer application of technologies to a fleet of vehicles that was otherwise held fixed across policy alternatives. With the addition of a consumer response component that models market share shifts, OMEGA2 utilizes absolute costs and emissions rates to compare vehicle design and purchase decisions across vehicle types and market classes."

Some of these may be provided by direct empirical observations, for example the number of currently registered vehicles. Others might be generated by modeling tools outside of OMEGA, such as physics-based vehicle simulation results produced by EPA\u2019s ALPHA model, or transportation demand forecasts from DOE\u2019s NEMS model. OMEGA has adopted data elements and structures that are generic, wherever possible, so that inputs can be provided from whichever sources the user deems most appropriate. The inputs and assumptions are categorized according to whether they define the policies under consideration or define the context within which the analysis occurs. Policy alternative inputs describe the standards themselves, including the program elements and methodologies for determining compliance as would be defined for an EPA rule in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. Analysis context inputs and assumptions cover the range of factors that the user assumes are independent of the policy alternatives. The context inputs may include fuel costs, costs and emissions rates for a particular vehicle technology package, attributes of the existing vehicle stock, consumer demand parameters, existing GHG credit balances, producer decision parameters, and many more. The user may project changes in the context inputs over the analysis timeframe based on other sources, but for a given analysis year the context definition requires that these inputs are common across the policy alternatives being compared. The primary outputs are the environmental effects, societal costs and benefits, and producer compliance status for a set of policy alternatives within a given analysis context. These outputs are expressed in absolute values, so that incremental effects, costs, and benefits can be evaluated by comparing two policy alternatives for a given analysis context. For example, comparing a No Action scenario to an Action (or Policy) Alternative. Those same policy alternatives can also be compared using other analysis context inputs to evaluate the sensitivity of results to uncertainty in particular assumptions. For example, comparing the incremental effects of a new policy in high fuel price and low fuel price analysis contexts."

The four main modules \u2014 Producer, Consumer, Policy, and Effects \u2014 are each defined along the lines of their real-world analogs. Producers and consumers are represented as distinct decision-making agents, which each exist apart from the regulations defined in the Policy Module. Similarly, the effects, both environmental and societal, exist apart from producer and consumer decision-making agents and the policy. This structure allows a user to analyze policy alternatives with consistently defined producer and consumer behavior. It also provides users the option of interchanging any of OMEGA\u2019s default modules with their own, while preserving the consistency and functionality of the larger model. Producer Module: This module projects the decisions of the regulated entities (producers) in response to policy alternatives, while accounting for consumer demand. The regulated entities can be specified as individual companies, or considered in aggregate as a collection of companies, depending on the assumptions made by the user regarding how GHG credits are averaged or transferred between entities. Consumer Module: This module projects demand for vehicle sales, ownership and use in response to changes in vehicle characteristics such as price, ownership cost, and other key attributes. Policy Module: This module determines the compliance status for a producer\u2019s possible fleet of new vehicles based on the characteristics of those vehicles and the policy defined by the user. Policies may be defined as performance-based standards using fleet averaging (for example, determining compliance status by the accounting of fungible GHG credits), as a fixed requirement without averaging (for example, a minimum required share of BEVs), or as a combination of performance-based standards and fixed requirements. Effects Module: This module projects the physical and cost effects that result from the modeling of producers, consumers, and policy within a given analysis context. Examples of physical effects include the stock and use of registered vehicles, electricity, and gasoline consumption, and the GHG and criteria pollutant emissions from tailpipe and upstream sources. Examples of cost effects include vehicle production costs, ownership and operation costs, societal costs associated with GHG and criteria pollutants, and other societal costs associated with vehicle use."

OMEGA2\u2019s Producer and Consumer modules represent distinct decision-making entities, with behaviors defined separately by the user. Without some type of interaction between these modules, the model would likely not arrive at an equilibrium of vehicles supplied and demanded. For example, a compliance solution which only minimizes producer generalized costs without consideration of consumer demand may not satisfy the market requirements at the fleet mix and level of sales preferred by the consumer. Similarly, the interaction between Producer and Policy modules ensures that that with each subsequent iteration, the compliance status for the new vehicle fleet under consideration is correctly accounted for by the producer. Since there is no general analytical solution to this problem of alignment between producers, consumers, and policy which also allows model users to independently define producer and consumer behavior and the policy alternatives, OMEGA2 uses an iterative search approach."

The software tool is a MATLAB/Simulink based simulation. ALPHA is capable of estimating CO2 emission values for many different vehicle types and technology packages. OMEGA needs to quickly estimate the CO2 emission values for each future vehicle considered along with estimates for future fleets. Because operating ALPHA in real time to conduct full vehicle simulations is time prohibitive, EPA developed a methodology of reproducing ALPHA model CO2 values using an industry standard statistical technique known as response surface methodology (RSM). (Kleijnen 2015) This methodology is used to computationally access CO2 results from a complete set of ALPHA model results by generating a collection of response surface equations (RSEs) that represent those simulation results. In 2018, EPA commissioned RTI International to conduct an independent peer review of an earlier version of the RSE methodology. (RTI International 2018) ALPHA simulates a single combination of technologies (known as a technology package) across different combinations of vehicle parameters. Each set of ALPHA simulation outputs are processed to create the RSEs needed for each technology package addressed. These RSEs are subsequently used within OMEGA to quickly reproduce the ALPHA model estimates for CO2 in real time for the various vehicle technologies. ALPHA's role in the creation of the RSEs for use within OMEGA is shown in Figure 2-3 and described in detail in Section 2.4.10. Figure 2-3. Relationship of ALPHA, RSEs and OMEGA."

The control strategies used in ALPHA are modeled after strategies observed during actual vehicle testing. The performance of vehicle packages defined within ALPHA can be modeled over any predetermined vehicle drive cycle. To determine fuel consumption values used to calculate LD GHG rule CO2 values, the FTP and HWFET cycles are simulated, separated by a HWFET prep cycle as normally run during certification testing. ALPHA does not include a temperature model, so the FTP is simulated assuming warm component efficiencies for all bags. Additional fuel consumption due to the FTP cold start is calculated in post-processing by applying a fuel consumption penalty to bags 1 and 2, depending on the assumed warmup strategy (refer to Section 5.3.3.2.5 of the 2016 Draft Technical Assessment Report (U.S. EPA; U.S. DOT-NHTSA; CARB 2016)).

Early in the development phase of ALPHA 3.0, EPA conducted research to determine which electrified vehicle architectures should be included in ALPHA\u2019s suite of models (W. Zhuanga, S. Li (Eben), X. Zhangc, D. Kum, Z. Song, G. Yin, F. Ju, 2020). Based on trends of the various hybrid and electric vehicles available for sale in the US in recent years, the conclusion was the electrified vehicle market could be modeled with the addition of three hybrid vehicle architectures and one battery electric vehicle architecture to the base conventional vehicle architecture. Figure 2-4 summarizes the five vehicle models used to simulate vehicle efficiency for this proposal, including the conventional model used in previous versions of ALPHA, the three new hybrid models, and the one new battery electric vehicle model added for ALPHA 3.0. A summary of these five vehicle architectures used in ALPHA 3.0 is provided in the sections below.

                "content": " There are a wide variety of possible hybrid-electric vehicle architectures, many of which are or have been represented in the fleet. To assess the scope of this variety, EPA used a recent hybrid architecture survey paper (W. Zhuanga, S. Li (Eben), X. Zhangc, D. Kum, Z. Song, G. Yin, F. Ju, 2020). Although other researchers may use a different terminology for specific architectures, in the interest of consistency EPA adopted the categorization and nomenclature of the authors in this survey paper for further discussion of hybrid-electric vehicle architectures. The CO2 performance of hybrid vehicles in ALPHA is modeled using one mild and two strong hybrid architectures. The mild hybrid architecture chosen was a parallel P0 configuration (referred to later as simply \"P0\"). The two strong hybrid architectures chosen were a parallel P2 configuration (referred to later as simply \"P2\") and a PowerSplit configuration patterned after the Toyota Prius (referred to later as simply \"PowerSplit\"). While other mild and strong hybrid architectures also exist in the fleet, for example parallel P1 configurations (referred to later as \"P1\"), series configurations, and series-parallel multi-mode configurations (referred to later as \"series-parallel\"), EPA's analysis in section 2.4.8.5 and 2.4.8.6 shows that these hybrid variations can be adequately modeled using the three core hybrid architectures chosen for incorporation into ALPHA 3.0. An analysis of the MY 2019 vehicle fleet revealed that nearly 30 percent of all hybrid vehicles in the MY 2019 fleet were mild hybrids, and the remaining 70 percent were strong hybrids (Table 2-1). Of the strong hybrids, 68 percent were based on PowerSplit architecture, 16 percent were based on P2 hybrid technology, and the remaining 16 percent were based on other architectures such as series-parallel and pure series architectures. The following will discuss the different hybrid models incorporated into ALPHA 3.0 to simulate these different types of hybrid vehicles.

The other 5 percent of mild hybrids were based on a P1 design, where the starter generator is directly mounted on the backside of the engine without the use of a belt. Mercedes was the only manufacturer of P1 mild hybrids in 2019. Analysis of P0 and P1 hybrids in the MY 2019 fleet presented later in this chapter (section 2.4.8.5) indicates the P1 variant of mild hybrids, although more efficient than the P0 architecture, can be reasonably represented by ALPHA\u2019s P0 mild hybrid model. Consequently, the ALPHA P0 model was chosen to simulate all the mild hybrids associated with this proposal."

                "content": " ALPHA 3.0 uses two distinct models to simulate strong hybrid-electric vehicles in the U.S. vehicle fleet. The PowerSplit hybrid architecture is shown in Figure 2-7. This architecture includes a dedicated hybrid engine specifically designed to provide higher efficiency at the more stable engine loads possible with a PowerSplit powertrain. ALPHA 3.0 models the PowerSplit device using a planetary arrangement like that in the third-generation Prius, with the engine mated to the planetary's carrier gear, Motor/Generator 1 (MG1) connected the sun gear, and Motor/Generator 2 (and its associated planetary gear) connected to both the ring gear and drive axle (through the final drive gear). The PowerSplit device balances the torque between the engine, MG1 and MG2/drive axle to provide the needed torque to the wheels while optimizing efficiency of the powertrain components. The battery for a typical mid-sized PowerSplit hybrid electric vehicle is around 1.6 kWh. The battery capacity of a similar sized plug-in hybrid version of PowerSplit hybrid is around 10 kWh. Table 2-1 illustrates that 68 percent of the strong hybrid vehicles in the MY 2019 fleet are the PowerSplit architecture. The biggest producer of PowerSplit hybrids in MY 2019 by far (both by number of vehicle models and total sales) was Toyota. Ford, FCA, and Subaru also offered a plug-in version of the PowerSplit architecture on at least one vehicle model, and GM sold a multi-mode version of the PowerSplit design. The PowerSplit model also delivered suitable CO2 predictions for other strong hybrids design (e.g., series-parallel and pure series architecture), which represent 16 percent16 of the remaining MY 2019 hybrid fleet. In total, ALPHA\u2019s PowerSplit strong hybrid model was used to simulate 84 percent of the MY 2019 strong hybrid fleet. 16 Slightly more than half of these remaining vehicles are based on a series-parallel hybrid design like the Honda Accord hybrid. While the CO2 performance of a series-parallel hybrid can be estimated using a PowerSplit hybrid architecture, EPA is developing a dedicated series-parallel model for future use in ALPHA. Figure 2-7: PowerSplit strong hybrid-electric architecture (& planetary gear arrangement). The P2 hybrid architecture illustrated in Figure 2-8 is the second strong hybrid-electric model used within ALPHA. This hybrid architecture uses a conventional or a dedicated hybrid engine and a conventional 6 speed (or higher) automatic transmission with a clutch and electric motor/generator in place of the standard torque converter for a conventional vehicle. The P2 architecture has higher power and torque capability due to the full power engine and transmission and is suitable for truck and large SUV applications with towing capability. The battery energy capacity of a typical P2 strong hybrid vehicle is around 1.6 kWh (same as the PowerSplit strong hybrid). The battery capacity of a similar sized plug-in hybrid version of P2 hybrid is around 10 kWh. Table 2-1 shows that 16 percent of the strong hybrids in the MY 2019 fleet are based on a P2 design. Leading manufacturers of P2 hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles include Hyundai/Kia, BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche AG. Figure 2-8: P2 strong hybrid-electric architecture."

For example, Figure 2-12 compares data from the PowerSplit model against the corresponding measured test data on a 2016 Toyota Prius Prime. This validation process similar to what was done in previously for conventional vehicles. (Newman, K., Kargul, J., and Barba, D. 2015b) Figure 2-12: Sample validation comparison of modeled versus measured data from a 2016 Toyota Prius Prime operating on the drive schedule between 680 to 820 seconds. Table 2-7 summarizes the final results of the strong hybrid and BEV models. For the PowerSplit strong hybrid model, the ALPHA simulated combined city-highway CO2 grams per mile was 3.5 percent higher than that of the 2017 Toyota Prius Prime driven on the dynamometer. For the P2 strong hybrid model, the combined city-highway simulation results were -4.4 percent lower than the 2016 Hyundai Sonata PHEV tested on the chassis dyno. Finally, the combined results from the BEV model were 1.1 percent higher than the test data from the 2018 Tesla Model 3. Table 2-7: Percent difference of ALPHA vehicle validation simulation versus benchmarking test data Model: Validation Vehicle Hot UDDS HW US06 Combined (hot-UDDS & HW) Units Power Split Strong Hybrid: 2017 Toyota Prius Prime PHEV 3.2% 3.9% -2.5% 3.5% % Diff CO2 g/mi P2 Strong Hybrid: 2016 Hyundai Sonata PHEV -8.3% 0.4% -6.6% -4.4% % Diff CO2 g/mi Battery Electric Vehicle: 2018 Tesla Model 3 -0.8% 3.4% 1.6% 1.1% % Diff kWh/mi Comments regarding the P2 validation results: Normally EPA targets +/- 4 percent difference between the simulation and the test vehicle for each drive cycle in its validation efforts. In case of the P2 model, Table 2-7 shows a -8.3 percent difference for the hot UDDS cycle and a -6.6 percent difference for the US06 cycle. While the combined UDDS/HW result is close to 4 percent difference, there could be two reasons for this wider difference of the values for the individual cycles. The Toyota A25A-FKS engine was used as a surrogate for the 2016 Hyundai Sonata engine, which was not available as an ALPHA input. Without the actual Hyundai engine map, it would be expected the simulation results would be slightly different than the test vehicle data. It is possible that coastdown coefficient adjustments for P2 strong hybrids do not adequately account for the losses that occur when the electric motor is always connected to the input of the transmission. (Moskalik 2020) Typical test-to-test variation of chassis dynamometer testing can be +/-3 percent due to a variety of factors such as different drivers, measurement equipment, fuel, and facilities. Since the test vehicle test data used in the P2 model came from several different laboratories, and other differences between the dynamometer results and simulation results (as noted above) would lead to even greater variation, the combined vehicle validation differences are reasonable when considering the factors listed. However, EPA intends to continue working to refine ALPHA's P2 strong hybrid model for the final rulemaking."

Therefore, the next step in the validation process was to verify the ALPHA model against a number of similar, but different, vehicles (think of these other vehicles as \"sibling\" or \"cousin\" vehicles). These variant vehicles were selected because they have very similar powertrain designs and control strategies to the initial validation vehicle, yet they may of different size and make. Additionally, the Certification data originates from different vehicles, drivers, equipment, and laboratories, all of which increases the variability of the comparisons, and can yield a measure of how well the validated model can simulate other vehicles. Once each vehicle model was developed and tuned to provide similar behavior as its test vehicle, CO2 (for hybrid operation) and energy consumption (for BEVs and PHEVs running in charge depleting mode) results were compared for other \"variant\" vehicles from the same manufacturer with very similar powertrain designs as the original validation vehicle. Since there were no dynamometer test data for these variant vehicles, the ALPHA simulation results were checked to see how close they agreed with available vehicle Certification data.

This comparison shows the average CO2 percent difference over the three drive cycles (FTP, HW and US06) to -6.1 percent, 2.2 percent and -10.1 percent, respectively. Again, as mentioned in the discussion of the P2 validation, the primary reasons this lower FTP and US06 differences is because the Toyota A25A-FKS engine was used as a surrogate for the 2016 Hyundai Sonata engine. Without the actual Hyundai engine map, it would be expected the simulation results would be slightly different than the certification data. The average percent difference of the combined (cold FTP-HW) CO2 values is shown to be -2.6 percent. The standard deviation of these combined averages is shown to be 3.6 percent. \u2022 The bottom row of Table 2-8 summarizes the average difference between a Tesla BEV's ALPHA estimated energy consumption (kWh/mi) and its Certification energy consumption (kWh/mi) for 14 variants of the Tesla Model 3 design. This comparison shows the average kWh/mi percent difference over the three drive cycles (FTP and HW) to 4.1 percent, 2.6 percent, respectively. No US06 Certification data were available for this comparison. The average percent difference of the combined (FTPHW) CO2 values is shown to be 3.4 percent. The standard deviation of these combined averages is shown to be 4.3 percent. Comparing the combined city-highway averages of the variant vehicle simulations in Table variability, which was expected given the validated model was tuned using a specific vehicle, yet it being asked to estimate results for slightly different vehicles.

Because these data sources were generally not originally developed for this particular use, any single source will often provide only partial coverage of vehicle models over the years of interest, and production volume data necessary for generating aggregate statistics is often lacking. This section describes a methodology for consolidating data from multiple sources, while maintaining the integrity of the original data. The most basic obstacle to consolidating data sets is variation in how vehicles are classified in different data sources. This might include variation in the level of detail as well as variation in the particular dimensions along which vehicles are characterized. Even when various data sets share a common categorization method, merging multiple sources may still be complicated when one or more of the data sets does not include the entire range of vehicles. The primary data source used by EPA to characterize the GHG performance of the existing fleet is the certification data submitted by manufacturers to EPA\u2019s VERIFY database. The data pertain mainly to vehicle emissions performance collected in dynamometer testing, and include a general classification of engines, transmissions, and drive systems. Also included are vehicle characteristics related to road loads: dynamometer target and set coefficients, road load horsepower, and test weights. Additional data is obtained from EPA\u2019s Test Car database, which is publicly available. In addition to the information in datasets maintained by EPA, additional vehicle specifications and technology details can be obtained through other public and commercially available sources of vehicle data such as Edmunds.com\u00a9, Wards Automotive (Penton\u00a9) and AllData Repair (AllData LLC\u00a9).

Likewise, the electric motors for strong hybrids are based on the motors shown in Table 2-3, and the batteries are based on the batteries from Table The range of strong hybrids in the fleet covers multiple manufacturers, vehicle applications, hybrid configurations and operational strategies. Additionally, not all strong hybrids have a dedicated hybrid engine as modeled in ALPHA. However, it was judged that using these two strong hybrid models would be reasonably representative of the fleet. In a similar way to conventional vehicles, the engine model in each hybrid vehicle was resized to match the given power of the vehicle engine as discussed above. For the vehicles modeled as a P2, the chosen engine was coupled to a six-speed transmission, based on the TRX12. PowerSplit vehicles used a planetary gearset based on the Toyota Prius. The electric motors were sized using the values reported by the manufacturers. PowerSplit generators were sized as a function of the rated engine power to keep the power values proportional. Additionally, the motor sizes for the series-parallel vehicles (modeled as PowerSplits) were also sized as a function of the rated engine power, to maintain reasonable motor sizes for that configuration.

EPA's approach for validations was to use detailed 10hz CAN and discrete sensor vehicle benchmarking data to set up the model structure and tune it based on e-motor and battery current and voltage, engine speed and load, battery SOH, etc. to generally achieve within 2- 4 percent agreement with the CO2 measured over the city, highway and US06 EPA regulatory cycles as shown in Table 2-7. Once the benchmarking test vehicle validation target was achieved (generally after 3-6 months of work), the validated model was applied to variant vehicles with the same powertrain design from the same manufacturer to achieve within 3-6 percent agreement on CO2 with EPA certification data over the combined FTP/Highway cycle. Then the validated model was applied to the broader fleet of similar technology hybrid/BEV vehicles to understand the variation in the hybrid/BEV performance (CO2 g/mile or kWh/mile) across manufacturers. Highlights of the peer reviewer comments were not ready at the time of this draft. However, the peer review of the added electrified models in ALPHA can be found on EPA ALPHA webpage (U.S. EPA 2023a)."

These parameters were: \u2022 Equivalent test weight (ETW). \u2022 Road load horsepower at 20 mph, calculated from the target coefficients (this value is substantially dominated by rolling resistance losses). \u2022 Road load horsepower at 60 mph, calculated from the target coefficients (this value is substantially dominated by aerodynamic losses). \u2022 Rated power of primary power source (engine or electric motor). The calculated road loads at 20 mph and 60 mph were chosen to characterize vehicle losses rather than the coefficient of rolling resistance and drag coefficient. The choice of road loads to characterize losses ensures that all road load losses in base year vehicles are correctly accounted for, while the choice of two widely separated speeds gives parameters combinations where road loads dominated by rolling resistance (at low speed) and aero resistance (at high speed) can be separately altered. In choosing which combinations of parameters to simulate, combinations of parameters that would not appear in the real fleet were avoided. For example, vehicles with very high ETW would not also have low road loads, as both weight and road load are correlated to vehicle size. With that in mind, rather than independently setting the value of each parameter, values of road loads and engine/motor power were chosen to be proportional to ETW. In other words, the parameters set were: \u2022 Equivalent test weight (ETW) \u2022 Road load horsepower at 20 mph / ETW (RLHP@20/ETW) \u2022 Road load horsepower at 60 mph / ETW (RLHP@60/ETW) \u2022 ETW / rated power (ETW/HP) To determine the ranges of these parameters for light-duty RSEs, the values of ETW, target coefficients, and rated power from the EPA\u2019s publicly available \"Data on Cars used for Testing Fuel Economy from MY 2021\" were used. (U.S. EPA 2022e) As shown in Figure 2-18, ETW values range from 2500 pounds to 7000 pounds, and the values of RLHP@20/ETW, RLHP@60/ETW, and ETW/HP are roughly consistent across the span of ETW. Additionally, the road loads at 20 mph and 60 mph are related, and thus so are the values of RLHP@20/ETW and RLHP@60/ETW. When choosing parameters to simulate, only combinations of RLHP@20/ETW and RLHP@60/ETW that were near the envelope of points shown in Figure 2-18 were chosen. Figure 2-18: Relationships between vehicle parameters for the MY 2021 fleet. For each RSE, discrete values of ETW, corresponding to test weight bins, were chosen spanning from 3000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. Four values of RLHP@20/ETW were chosen (0.0003, 0.0005, 0.00075, and 0.001 HP/lb), and for each value of RLHP@20/ETW, three values of RLHP@60/ETW were chosen which spanned the point cloud shown in Figure 2-18. Finally, for conventional vehicles, engine sizes were assigned so that the ETW/HP spanned the values shown in Figure 2-18. The engines sizes were chosen from the displacements listed in Table 2-22. For hybrid vehicles, the same set of engine sizes were used. For BEVs, electric motor sizes were chosen in 50kW increments from 100 kW to 400 kW.

The quadratic target coefficients (designated \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" for the constant, linear, and quadratic term, respectively) were determined using the values of RLHP@20 and RLHP@60. To do so, the linear (B) coefficient was assumed to be 0.22 pounds/mph, representing the average value for that coefficient in the MY 2021 fleet. The constant (A) and quadratic (C) coefficients were then calculated to give the correct values for RLHP@20 and RLHP@60. Although this method does constrain the range of coefficients generated (as the linear term is always 0.22 lbs/mph), the resulting quadratic target force curve accurately reflects a wide range of target curves. For example, recalculating the target coefficients of the MY 2021 fleet with this methodology results in a difference between the original and recalculated curves at 40 mph (midway between 20 and 60) of less than 4 percent for over 97 percent of the vehicles.

More importantly, costs are now determined as absolute costs rather than incremental costs and geared toward generating full vehicle costs rather than the incremental costs considered in previous analyses. That is, when the cost of a new piece of technology or package of technologies is assigned, it is in terms of its absolute cost instead of the incremental cost relative to the older or less capable piece of technology or package of technologies that it replaces. This is an important aspect of the OMEGA technology costs because OMEGA now incorporates a consumer choice element. This means that the impacts of, for example, a $40,000 BEV versus a $35,000 ICE vehicle of similar utility (i.e., a 14 percent increase for the BEV) is a much different consideration than a $6,000 incremental BEV cost versus a $1,000 incremental ICE cost (a 500 percent increase for the BEV)."

This involved first determining the battery power and gross energy capacity needed by each, and then using ANL BatPaC to determine the direct manufacturing cost (DMC) for each battery, in dollars per pack. These costs were assigned to a base year, and costs in future years were estimated by applying a learning curve to the base year costs. Later, in the 2021 rule, NHTSA estimated battery costs by means of lookup tables derived from ANL BatPaC, in which energy capacity (kWh) and battery power (kW) were the primary variables. Future costs again were estimated by applying a learning curve. For this proposal, EPA used ANL BatPaC 5.0 to develop base year (MY 2022) battery costs, expressed as a cost per kWh as a function of battery gross energy capacity (kWh). To assign costs for future years, we applied a cost reduction due to learning, based on cumulative Gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery production necessary to supply the number of BEVs that OMEGA has placed in the analysis fleet up to that analysis year. Finally, we applied additional manufacturing cost reductions based on our assessment of the future impact of the Inflation Reduction Act."

One difference from previous versions of OMEGA is that the new version directly calculates and assigns the gross battery capacity of PEVs. When the updated version of OMEGA generates a BEV, it determines the necessary gross battery capacity (kWh) for that vehicle given its estimate of the vehicle's energy consumption as a BEV, its target driving range, and other relevant factors. The direct manufacturing cost for a pack of that capacity is then estimated based on the gross capacity, the cost is reduced by application of a learning factor, and this cost becomes a term in the calculation of the total direct manufacturing cost of the vehicle. Determining the correct gross battery capacity is important because this determines the energy consumption of the vehicle (which is in turn a result of battery weight) and also battery cost. Gross battery capacity is generally a function of the desired electric driving range, the fraction of gross battery capacity that is usable (the SOC swing, in percent), and the on-road DC energy consumption of the vehicle. The driving range is assumed to be 75 percent of the 55/45 2-cycle range which is consistent with higher volume BEVs in the market today and which we expect to be more representative of future BEVs.18 SOC swing for a BEV is assumed to be about 90 to 95 percent. DC energy consumption is the average amount of on-road DC energy required from the battery per mile driven on the relevant cycles. Note that this is not the same as the energy consumption reported in the Fuel Economy guide, which includes charging losses incurred between the grid power outlet and the battery. Charging losses are important for calculating 18 While it varies by model, the current FE label range for BEVs is between 70-75 percent of the 2-cycle range. upstream emissions but must be excluded for battery sizing because battery capacity for a given range is a function of DC energy consumption. DC energy consumption is derived from a precomputed response surface generated by ALPHA results, using curb weight and other vehicle attributes as inputs to the response surface. Curb weight is intimately tied to battery capacity, via the effect of battery weight on total vehicle weight. This requires an iterative process that OMEGA must perform in order to determine curb weight simultaneously with arriving at the necessary battery size. In the first step, OMEGA calculates the on-road DC energy consumption (Wh/mi) as a function of vehicle parameters including curb weight (which includes a battery weight determined by later steps).

                "content": " To begin estimating cost for a pack in a given year of the analysis, OMEGA first requires battery cost to be input as a base-year input cost function representing the pack cost per kWh, as a function of its gross kWh capacity, in the base year (2022). The base year input cost function was defined as a relationship between the gross capacity of the battery (kWh) and the cost per kWh. It is generally understood and confirmed via BatPaC simulation that the cost per kWh for a pack of a given chemistry varies with the gross capacity of the pack, with packs of larger capacity generally indicating a lower cost per kWh than those of a smaller capacity. While power can also be a determinant of battery cost, for PEV batteries (as opposed to HEV batteries) energy capacity is the dominant factor, and through simulation exercises EPA determined that including power as an input variable in the costing of PEV battery packs would not meaningfully affect the results. In developing the input cost functions, PEV batteries were assigned a power-to-energy ratio generally appropriate to the vehicle, considering typical power requirements and the size of the battery. To generate the BEV base year input cost function, EPA used Argonne National Laboratory's BatPaC model version 5.0. A copy of BatPaC version 5.0 was configured to generate a variety of battery packs that utilize pack topologies and cell sizes that are similar to those seen in emerging high-production battery platforms, such as for example the GM Ultium battery platform, the VW MEB vehicle platform, and the Hyundai E-GMP vehicle platform. EPA considers these platforms to exemplify the trend toward BEV-specific vehicle platforms with battery packs that can be assembled in several different capacities from various numbers of modules that utilize one or two standard cell sizes of relatively large capacity, generally forming a flat battery pack assembly suitable for residing in the vehicle floor. These platforms utilize pouch cells of relatively large capacity (78 to 100 Ampere-hours) that are used interchangeably in a range of pack sizes by varying the number of battery modules and their configuration within the pack. The modeled battery packs were generated by enumerating all possible combinations of cell size (from 60 to 90 A-hr in steps of 5 A-hr) and module arrangement, with 24 cells per module. For battery chemistry, EPA selected an NMC811 cathode with a graphite anode, which among the chemistries readily modeled by BatPaC, represents in our judgment the most appropriate representative chemistry found in battery packs of this design being produced today that is also consistent with trends to balance performance with reduced cobalt content. Default costs provided in BatPaC for electrode powders and other constituents were used. While ironphosphate cathodes are increasingly being used by some manufacturers, their lower specific energy and energy density may make them less appropriate for the BEV driving range of 300 miles modeled in the analysis. Of the enumerated pack configurations, those having too high or low a pack voltage (below 300V or above 1000V) were eliminated.19 We thus generated a range of engineering-feasible pack sizes and configurations, for which costs were determined and plotted as a function of pack capacity (kWh), for each of four annual production volumes (50,000, 125,000, 250,000, and 450,000), consistent with previous analyses. Power-law equations were then generated from the plotted points, representing cost as a function of pack capacity and production volume. The resulting equations are shown below, for each of the four annual manufacturing volumes. The battery chemistry is the NMC811-G energy battery defined in BatPaC 5.0. 50\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51: $/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e = 284.28 \u00d7 (gross \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e)\u22120.192 125\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51: $/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e = 270.69 \u00d7 (gross \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e)\u22120.188 250\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51: $/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e = 261.61 \u00d7 (gross \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e)\u22120.184 450\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51: $/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e = 254.62 \u00d7 (gross \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e)\u22120.182 Figure 2-20 below shows these equations plotted on their respective curves. 19 While most BEVs and PHEVs operate at about 350V to 400V, packs approaching 1000V were included in the plots due to the presence of dual-voltage packs in the market that can be charged at a similar voltage. Figure 2-20. Direct manufacturing cost estimates for BEV packs at various annual production volumes for NMC811-G chemistry, base year 2022. The equation for a production volume of 250,000 packs was then used as an input to OMEGA to represent a base year cost, applied to batteries produced in MY 2022. The annual volume of 250,000 is similar to that being produced in the largest plants today, such as those of Tesla, and also is appropriate for the purpose of causing the BatPaC model to calculate costs applicable to a production plant of 30 to 40 GWh capacity, which is a common plant capacity among the largest manufacturers today. The resulting cost for a 75 kWh battery, a commonly encountered size for BEV batteries in the market today, is about $120/kWh. HEV battery batteries are much smaller in capacity than BEV batteries but must deliver a significant amount of power in proportion to their capacity. The higher power-to-energy ratio means that power plays as strong a role as energy capacity in determining cost. Due to the small total capacity, these batteries also must be composed of smaller capacity cells in order to have enough cells in series to achieve the approximately 300V pack voltage that is commonly seen in HEVs. A population of HEV batteries was modeled in BatPaC 5.0, comprised of a single module of 72 cells of NMC811-G (Power) chemistry. These were configured for a range of capacities between 0.75 and 1.5 kWh, and power ratings between about 18 kW and 48 kW, based on expected power and energy requirements for a variety of vehicles styles and sizes. This resulted power-to-energy ratios ranging from about 25 to 35. For HEV batteries (power split and P2), the following relationship between gross capacity and total pack cost was developed for NMC811-G (Power) chemistry in BatPaC 5.0. HEV batteries have a higher power-to-energy ratio than BEV batteries, and cost is therefore higher than for BEV batteries. Although HEV battery cost is more sensitive to power requirements than BEV batteries, it is possible to characterize HEV battery cost in terms of gross capacity as long as the higher power-to-energy ratio is maintained in the basis. The plot below shows the derived cost per pack for a range of HEV pack gross capacities. The plot shows that there is not much variation in HEV total pack cost within the range of capacities likely to be used in HEVs. Figure 2-21. Base year cost per pack for HEV batteries as a function of gross capacity The equivalent cost per gross kWh for HEV batteries is shown in the chart below. It demonstrates the fact that battery cost, when expressed on a dollar per kWh basis, is much higher for HEV batteries than for BEVs due to the difference in their power-to-energy ratio and their use of smaller cells to reach an appropriate voltage range for an HEV. Figure 2-22. Base year cost per kWh for HEV batteries as a function of gross capacity In general, MHEV batteries are even smaller in capacity than strong HEV batteries. These were given a single specification for all vehicles and costs were determined on that basis. We also developed costs for PHEV batteries. PHEV battery costs were estimated by generating a population of packs constructed with cells of varying cell capacities appropriate to achieve a proper voltage of about 350V and with a sufficient power-to-energy ratio (varying from about 6.5 to 9.5) for the application. The chemistry was NMC811-G (Power formulation) as defined in BatPaC 5.0. We found that this formulation performed well in both shorter-range and longer-range PHEVs, with little impact on cost, and so would be suitable for estimating battery cost in a wide range of PHEV applications. These batteries have sufficient cooling capacity for applications in which the sustained speed is 70 miles per hour in EV mode (as defined in BatPaC 5.0), making them suitable for providing substantial all-electric range. Power law equations were used to characterize the costs as a function of gross capacity in kWh and are depicted on Figure 2-27 below. Figure 2-23: Direct manufacturing costs derived from BatPaC 5.0 for PHEV batteries As described in the Preamble (IV.C.1), EPA has not specifically modeled the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) architectures in the analysis for this proposal. However, the agency recognizes that PHEVs can provide significant reductions in GHG emissions and that some vehicle manufacturers may choose to utilize this technology as part of their technology portfolio. EPA may rely upon these battery cost estimates and other information gathered in response to this proposal, and on EPA's on-going technical work, for estimating the battery costs for PHEVs for the final rule. The BatPaC spreadsheet models used to develop the costs for BEVs, HEVs, and PHEVs are available in the Docket (US EPA 2023) and fully describe the BatPaC inputs that were used to generate the cloud of battery pack cost points that are visible in the plots."

                "content": " To estimate battery pack costs for future years extending into the time frame of the rule and beyond, a dynamically generated learning factor was applied to the base year costs within OMEGA. When the OMEGA model generates a compliant fleet in a given future year of the analysis, battery costs for BEVs in that year are determined dynamically, by calculating a learning cost reduction factor to apply to the base year cost. The learning factor is calculated based on the cumulative GWh of battery production necessary to supply the number of BEVs that OMEGA has thus far placed in the analysis fleet, up to that analysis year. This is consistent with \"learning by doing,\" a standard basis for representing cost reductions due to learning in which a specific percentage cost reduction occurs with each doubling of cumulative production over time. This dynamic method of assigning a cost reduction due to learning means that OMEGA runs that result in different cumulative battery production levels will have result in somewhat different battery costs. For the years 2022 through 2025, we suspended use of the learning factor, to reflect consensus views that elevated mineral prices are likely to cause battery costs to remain flat for a time (for more discussion and sources, see the discussion of the reference trajectory, later in this section). For 2026 and later, we applied a learning factor. The learning factor equation is of the same form as that used in previous rules, assigning a cost reduction factor due to learning, as a function of cumulative production up to that point. The battery cost in a given year is calculated as follows: 1) Calculate the cumulative GWh needed by BEVs placed into the analysis fleet through last model year. 2) Calculate the cost reduction factor due to learning:20 factor = 4.1917 \u00d7 (cumulative \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e through last year)\u22120.225 3) Calculate battery cost in the base year, as a function of pack kWh, according to the equation in RIA 2.5.2.1.2: $/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e = 261.61 \u00d7 (gross \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\u210e)\u22120.184 4) Multiply the result of Step 3 by the result of Step 2. To support comparison of the resultant costs generated by OMEGA to forecasts of future battery costs found in the literature, we also developed a reference battery cost trajectory derived from a survey of the most recent forecasts. This trajectory was used only for qualitative comparison to help understand how well the OMEGA-generated costs compare to consensus views of future battery costs. 20 The exponent in this equation was calibrated to match a reference cost of $75 per kWh in 2035 under a no action GWh demand scenario. This cost is part of a reference cost trajectory discussed later in this section. In selecting the forecasts to consider, we noted that since the 2021 rule, it has become increasingly clear that mineral costs have risen sufficiently to interrupt historical trends of continuous battery cost reduction. For example, the BNEF 2021 battery price survey indicated that the pace of reduction had slowed considerably and predicted that costs may not reach $100/kWh (at pack level) until 2024. Elevated prices appear likely to persist for some amount of time due to speculation and increased demand as manufacturers work to secure long-term sources for their production needs. Although many forecasts of battery costs exist in the literature, most were developed prior to the manifestation of these recent mineral cost increases and may not fully capture their effects. Therefore, we gave particular attention to two sources that do reflect recent cost increases. Proprietary forecasts produced by Wood Mackenzie in Q3 2022 and provided to EPA as part of a subscription service (Wood Mackenzie 2022) include recent mineral cost considerations and forecasts. Another recent report by EDF/ERM (MacIntosh, Tolomiczenko and Van Horn 2022) includes a compilation of battery cost projections from a number of sources. Like most other projections of future battery costs found in the literature, these studies refer to direct manufacturing cost at the pack level and do not consider the effect of policy measures that may defray some of this cost from an accounting perspective, such as the IRA production tax credits, which are discussed in a later section. To develop the reference trajectory, we began with the base cost of $120 per kWh that was developed in Section 2.5.2.1.2, representing a 2022 direct manufacturing cost for a battery pack as described in that section (75 kWh, NMC811-G, at a production rate of 250,000 packs per year). We then sought to identify average battery pack costs per kWh expected to occur in future years by considering estimates from the Wood Mackenzie data and the EDF/ERM report. The Wood Mackenzie data suggest that battery costs have risen from previous lows and are poised to remain somewhat elevated until about 2025 to 2026, after which they are expected to resume their decline as mineral supply and demand balance out. Similarly, the EDF/ERM report's compilation of battery cost projections (reproduced below in Figure 2-23) shows costs flat from 2022 to 2023, and also references a 2022 BNEF estimate that predicts costs will remain flat to 2024. Considering all of these sources, we chose to keep the base year pack cost per kWh of $120 unchanged through 2025, which represents a conservative rate of decline relative the sources. Figure 2-24 Projected battery pack costs from various sources summarized by EDF/ERM Looking to 2026, the sources compiled in the EDF/ERM report suggest an average pack cost of $100/kWh. However, the midrange of Wood Mackenzie estimates for that year suggest a range of about $100-$130. We selected a point in between, at $110/kWh, giving a slightly larger weight to the EDF/ERM report due to its basis on multiple studies. Looking to 2029, the sources compiled in the EDF/ERM report suggest approximately $80/kWh, while the Wood Mackenzie forecast suggests about $90 to $110. Noting also that the DOE/ANL high case for battery cost in 2030 is $90/kWh, we selected $90/kWh which is between the Wood Mackenzie and EDF/ERM estimates. The potential for cost reductions to reach these levels by 2026 and 2029 is also supported by our observation that analysts largely expect the price of lithium to stabilize at or near its historical levels by the mid-2020s,21 suggesting that the elevated battery costs being reported today will not persist. Past 2029, fewer pack cost estimates are found in the literature, and such long-term estimates are by their nature more uncertain than shorter-term estimates. Often, analysts model costs over the longer term by assuming an annual percentage cost reduction rate. Therefore we adopted this approach for the years past 2029. We have assumed that by this time, some of the generally anticipated improvements in battery manufacturing will have already taken place, suggesting a lower rate of learning than was seen in earlier years. Starting at the $90/kWh selected for 2029, we applied a 3 percent per year reduction, which results in $75/kWh in 2035. Past 2035, we applied a 1 percent per year reduction which results in a decline to $65/kWh by 2050. This results in the reference trajectory for the cost of a representative 75 kWh battery as shown in Figure 2-24. 21 For example, see Sun et al., \u201cSurging lithium price will not impede the electric vehicle boom,\u201d Joule, doi:10.1016/j.joule. 2022.06.028 (https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2022.06.028). Figure 2-25. Reference trajectory of future battery pack manufacturing costs for a 75 kWh BEV pack As stated previously, this reference trajectory was used only for qualitative comparison to the battery costs that are generated by OMEGA, which are dependent on a learning factor that is a function of the cumulative GWh of battery production in a given run of the model. Since the reference trajectory was developed using sources that predate the proposal, it is taken to represent approximate consensus views of where battery costs are considered likely to go in the absence of additional battery production resulting from the proposed standards. As an example of how the pack direct manufacturing costs used in the analysis compare with the reference trajectory, Figure 2-25 shows the sales weighted average cost per kWh generated by OMEGA for the central case of the proposal, alongside the reference trajectory described above. Neither include the estimated impact of IRA 45X production tax credits for battery production, which are applied in a later step.22 The Proposal costs compare quite favorably to the reference trajectory and vary generally as expected. From 2022 to 2025 they are somewhat lower, due to the substantially larger average pack size (96 kWh to nearly 100 kWh) compared to the 75 kWh of the reference trajectory. Past 2027, the Proposal costs are also lower than the reference trajectory, again due in part to the larger pack size, and increasingly, to the growing cumulative production volume due to the additional BEVs driven by the proposal. 22 The impact of IRA 45X production tax credits on battery cost to manufacturers as modeled in OMEGA are developed and discussed in section 2.5.2.1.4. Figure 2-26: Example of pack direct manufacturing cost per kWh and average pack kWh generated by OMEGA The 96 kWh to 103 kWh average pack capacity of the BEVs in the proposal is due in part to their use in relatively large vehicles, such as large SUVs and light trucks, which form a significant part of the OMEGA modeled compliance fleet and to which OMEGA directs a significant amount of electrification in its identification of a least cost compliance pathway. Another factor is the use of a 300-mile driving range for all light-duty BEVs and MDV pickup truck BEVs in the analysis, which is a longer average range than in some other studies, but which EPA believes is an appropriate modeling choice to reflect currently prevailing range expectations by consumers. For medium-duty van BEVs, we assumed a 150-mile range due to the predominant use of this vehicle type within commercial parcel delivery and comparable to currently available BEV MDV vans (see Chapter 3.1.2). More discussion of the OMEGA model and the OMEGA results can be found in Preamble IV.C and elsewhere in this DRIA.

                "content": " To reflect the anticipated effect of the Inflation Reduction Act on battery costs to manufacturers, we applied a further cost reduction based on the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. This provision of the IRA provides a $35 per kWh tax credit for manufacturers of battery cells, and an additional $10 per kWh for manufacturers of battery modules, as well as a credit equal to 10 percent of the manufacturing cost of electrode active materials and another 10 percent for the manufacturing cost of critical minerals (all applicable to manufacture in the United States). The credits, with the exception of the critical minerals credit, phase out from 2030 to 2032. We estimated that, across the PEV industry as a whole, the capability of manufacturers to take advantage of the $35 cell credit and the $10 module credit would ramp up over time, as new U.S. battery manufacturing facilities come on line, allowing manufacturing to increasingly take place in the U.S. We ramped the modeling value of the credit linearly from 60 percent of total cells and modules in 2023 (a conservative estimate of the current percentage of U.S.-based battery and cell manufacturing likely to be eligible today for the credit)23 to 100 percent utilization in 2027, and then ramping down by 25 percent per year as the law phases out the credit from 2030 (75 percent) through 2033 (zero percent). Although a large percentage of 2023 U.S. BEV battery and cell manufacturing is represented by the production of one OEM, we believe that the many large U.S. battery production facilities that are being actively developed by suppliers and other OEMs (as described in IV.C.6 of the Preamble) will allow benefit of the credit to be accessible to all manufacturers by 2027. We also note that the high value of the credit provides a strong motivation for manufacturers to utilize it. For the purpose of modeling, the percentages above represent an average credit amount across the industry as a whole. Although some manufacturers and vehicles may realize the full value of the credit in any given year, the model requires an average value across the full market. Figure 2-26 shows an example of the resulting effect on average pack direct manufacturing costs (DMC) generated by OMEGA in the central case of the proposal, after application of the 45X credit. The 45X cell and module credits per kWh were applied not to the direct manufacturing cost per kWh, but to the marked-up cost per kWh (that is, after multiplying the direct manufacturing cost by the 1.5 retail price equivalent (RPE)). Because RPE is meant to be a multiplier against the direct manufacturing cost, and the 45X credit does not reduce the actual direct manufacturing cost at the factory but only compensates the cost after the fact, we felt that it was most appropriate to apply the 45X credit to the marked-up cost.. The 45X cell and module credits per kWh were applied by first marking up the direct manufacturing cost by the 1.5 RPE factor to determine the indirect cost (i.e., 50 percent of the manufacturing cost), then deducting the credit amount from the marked-up cost to create a post-credit marked-up cost. The postcredit direct manufacturing cost would then become the post-credit marked-up cost minus the indirect cost. 23 U.S. Department of Energy, \"FOTW #1192, June 28, 2021: Most U.S. Light-Duty Plug-In Electric Vehicle Battery Cells and Packs Produced Domestically from 2018 to 2020,\" June 28, 2021. https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1192-june-28-2021-most-us-light-duty-plug-electric-vehiclebattery Figure 2-27: Volume weighted average pack direct manufacturing cost and marked-up cost per kWh after application of 45X credit EPA did not apply a further cost reduction to represent the 10 percent electrode active material or critical mineral production credit, which are also available to be utilized by manufacturers. These credits are likely to have a substantial impact on reducing battery costs, and their exclusion from the currently modeled cost estimates represents a conservative assumption.

For past rulemakings we contracted with FEV North America to conduct teardowns of electrified vehicle components that were available at the time in order to establish direct manufacturing costs under high-volume production in a rigorous and transparent way. Since then, the ongoing evolution of electrified vehicles has led to the emergence of improved or entirely new components that benefit from improved manufacturing efficiencies, component integration, and platform optimization. These developments call for significant updates to the way we characterized and quantified vehicle costs in the past. In some cases, specific components that we costed in the past may have become integrated with other components, or their design has changed so they use less costly materials or can be manufactured in a more efficient way. The vehicle platforms that incorporate these components may also have changed to optimize their integration with the rest of the vehicle. Third-party teardowns of vehicles and components have also become more widely available from a number of engineering firms.

                "content": " We have also conducted a new full-vehicle teardown of two new vehicles with FEV North America (FEV Consulting Inc. 2022). We tore down a 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 BEV and a 2021 Volkswagen Tiguan, an ICE vehicle relatively equivalent to the ID.4 in size and function. This project was initiated in part due to the realization that platform optimization is likely to affect a variety of cost comparisons between ICE and BEV vehicles. For example, platform optimization, particularly for BEVs, could potentially lead to differences in indirect costs that are experienced by the manufacturer (such as assembly cost, certification cost, and calibration cost). We also considered that the differences between a platform-optimized BEV and a platformoptimized ICE vehicle might call for an absolute costing approach, instead of assuming that a BEV can be costed as an ICE vehicle with ICE components removed and BEV components added. The study was therefore designed not only to provide an additional source for vehicle component cost data, but also to inform several issues that are commonly cited with regard to the difference in cost between conventional and battery electric vehicles. Because ICE vehicles and BEVs are likely to be built on different dedicated platforms, the study was designed as a groundup study for which a complete costed bill of materials would be developed for every component of each vehicle, including structural and other non-powertrain components. This would support our intention to move to a costing regime based on absolute vehicle costs instead of relative or incremental costs (as previously described in 2.5.1), and to allow comparisons to be made on a vehicle-system basis to identify significant potential cost efficiencies attributable to a dedicated BEV platform. FEV was also asked to comment on potential differences in indirect costs for BEV design, certification, and calibration that might become apparent on a close inspection of the components, their system integration, and their assembly characteristics. We also specified that a detailed labor assessment be performed for each component, in order to shed light on differences in amount and type of assembly labor required for production. An additional task under this work assignment was to evaluate the non-battery HEV and PEV costs EPA has described under section 2.6.1 of this DRIA, with respect to the cost values used and the method of scaling these costs across different vehicle performance characteristics and vehicle classes. Delivery of the teardown study results by FEV was completed in February 2023 and a peer review is planned to be completed in mid-2023. The FEV review of non-battery costs and scaling is available in a memo to the Docket entitled \"EV Non-Battery Cost Review by FEV.\" In developing the costs used in this proposal, we have considered qualitative information gained thus far in conducting this project, and we expect to incorporate more information from the study in the final rule analysis."

UBS is a global financial services company originally from Switzerland and is one of the largest in the world. UBS contracted Munro & Associates to tear down a Chevy Bolt EV to better understand the profitability of 200+ mile EVs, particularly the Tesla Model 3. Because the teardown analysis was contracted to Munro & Associates, this suggests that the costs derived in the study are comparable to those of the Munro reports that EPA purchased, as well as the Ricardo teardown studies performed for CARB, which was subcontracted also to Munro & Associates. Since it was released, the UBS study has become a widely cited resource across the industry, as it was one of the first publicly accessible teardowns to provide individual component costs that were well documented and derived from what was a state-of-the-art vehicle at the time. The study also provided valuable insight into the breakdown of battery costs for this vehicle and related its content to the outlook for raw materials markets. Also in 2017, CARB published a teardown of selected power electronics and thermal systems in a report titled \"Advanced Strong Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis.\" (Ricardo Strategic Consulting and Munro and Associates 2017). The selected components were identified as representing the state-of-the-art for production vehicles at the time, and included two electric machines (one from the Toyota Prius and one from the Chevy Volt), two inverter modules (one from the Prius and one from Audi), and one DC-DC converter from the Ford Fusion. As with the UBS teardown, this teardown was subcontracted by Ricardo to Munro & Associates."

This report included cost estimates for various electric vehicle components including batteries and non-battery components, derived from a survey of a number of quantitative sources in the literature, combined with a qualitative assessment of their validity. The sources cited by NAS had significant overlap with the sources EPA used in its analysis, including reference to a presentation to NAS by Munro and Associates, as well as the 2017 UBS teardown and other sources. Accordingly, the costs in the NAS report were quite similar to those that were ultimately used in the EPA analysis. In some cases, the costs we used differ from the costs cited by NAS, largely because EPA had access to a larger diversity of teardown reports, some of which were not available to NAS at the time of their research. In 2021 and 2022, CARB developed ZEV component costs for use in their ACC II program, and ultimately published two versions of a ZEV costing workbook (California Air Resources Board 2022) and invited public comment on the costs it reported. When EPA developed its cost estimates, CARB staff worked jointly with EPA to analyze the teardown data and much of this work was reflected in CARB's costs. Owing to the differences between specific goals of the CARB ACC II cost analysis and that of EPA, some costs in the CARB workbook were developed differently to reflect differences in vehicle configuration or performance expectations resulting from the specific regional focus and regulatory environment of the CARB program. In general, the costs used by EPA and those within the CARB workbook are in good alignment. In October 2022, ICCT released a report (Slowik, et al. 2022) that included an analysis of future EV component and battery costs. As with many third-party studies, the ICCT report differs from the EPA analysis in certain aspects of its approach and assumptions. In general, the costs EPA developed are not inconsistent with the costs assumed by ICCT."

                "content": " To produce a unit of output, vehicle manufacturers incur direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include cost of materials and labor costs. Indirect costs are all the costs associated with producing the unit of output that are not direct costs \u2013 for example, they may be related to production (such as research and development, R&D), corporate operations (such as salaries, pensions, and health care costs for corporate staff), or selling (such as transportation, dealer support, and marketing). Indirect costs are generally recovered by allocating a share of the costs to each unit of good sold. Although it is possible to account for direct costs allocated to each unit of good sold, it is more challenging to account for indirect costs allocated to a unit of goods sold. To make a cost analysis process more feasible, markup factors, which relate total indirect costs to total direct costs, have been developed. These factors are often referred to as a retail price equivalent (RPE) markup. EPA has frequently used cost multipliers to predict the resultant impact on costs associated with manufacturers\u2019 responses to regulatory requirements. The best approach, if it were possible, to determining the impact of changes in direct manufacturing costs on a manufacturer\u2019s indirect costs would be to estimate the cost impact on each indirect cost element. However, doing this within the constraints of an agency\u2019s time or budget is not always feasible, or the technical, financial, and accounting information to carry out such an analysis may simply be unavailable. The RPE multiplier, or RPE markup factor, is based on an examination of historical financial data contained in 10-K reports filed by manufacturers with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It represents the ratio between the retail price of motor vehicles and the direct costs of all activities that manufacturers engage in. The RPE markup provides, at an aggregate level, the relative shares of revenues (Revenue = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Net Income) to direct manufacturing costs as shown in Table 2-28. Using the RPE markup implicitly assumes that incremental changes in direct manufacturing costs produce common incremental changes in all indirect cost contributors as well as net income. However, a concern in using the RPE markup in cost analysis for new technologies added in response to regulatory requirements is that the indirect costs of vehicle modifications are not likely to be the same for different technologies. For example, less complex technologies could require fewer R&D efforts or less warranty coverage than more complex technologies. In addition, some simple technological adjustments may, for example, have no effect on the number of corporate personnel and the indirect costs attributable to those personnel. The use of a single RPE markup, with its assumption that all technologies have the same proportion of indirect costs, is likely to overestimate the costs of less complex technologies and underestimate the costs of more complex technologies. Table 2-27 Retail Price Equivalent Factors in the Heavy-Duty and Light-Duty Industries (Rogozhin 2009) Cost Contributor Contribution to Cost Direct manufacturing cost 1.0 Warranty 0.03 R&D 0.05 Other (administrative, retirement, health, etc.) 0.36 Profit (cost of capital) 0.06 Retail price equivalent 1.50 To address this concern, modified multipliers were developed by EPA, working with a contractor, for use in past EPA rulemakings. (Rogozhin 2009) Those modified multipliers were referred to Indirect Cost Multipliers, or ICMs, and EPA applied low magnitude ICMs (i.e., <the"

This way, we could analyze the possible pathways toward compliance with GHG regulations via, for example, application of many low complexity technologies versus few high complexity technologies. In other words, we could weigh one technology against another in a more finely tuned way. The ICM approach served us well when dealing with incremental technology applications and incremental costs for those technologies as was done in the 2010 and 2012 final rules (75 FR 25324 2010, 77 FR 62624 2012). However, as noted above, we no longer use that approach to estimating compliance pathways. In contrast, since we now consider the whole vehicle and its total cost and performance toward compliance, we no longer need the fine tuning of one technology versus another that the ICM approach provided. As a result, for this analysis, we are using the full RPE markup as the indirect cost markup as we did in our 2021 final rule (86 FR 74434 2021)."

                "content": " EPA reviewed several recent teardown reports to develop direct manufacturing costs for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) and for induction motors. The primary sources we consulted to establish an estimate of base year electric machine costs included the 2017 UBS teardown of the Chevy Bolt, the CARB teardown performed by Ricardo, the Munro 12-motor teardown report, and the full-vehicle Munro teardown reports for the 2017 Tesla Model 3 Long Range RWD and the 2020 Tesla Model Y AWD Performance. The Munro reports are proprietary commercial products describing teardowns performed by Munro & Associates, copies of which EPA licensed to support its research. The reports provided cost data points for a variety of PMSM and induction machines of various power ratings and a range of designs. As shown in Table 2-27, costs for several PMSM motors were available in these reports. Table 2-37: PMSM Motors Described in Munro Reports PMSM motors kW Tesla 2017 Model 3 LR RWD 192 Tesla 2020 Model Y AWD Perf - Rear 219 GM 2017 Chevy Bolt EV 150 BMW 2015 i3 125 Nissan 2019 Leaf 110 Jaguar 2019 i-Pace EV400 90 kWh AWD 147 GM 2016 Chevy Volt PHEV 41 Toyota 2016 Prius HEV 53 Of these, we focused on the Tesla components as best representing the state of the art for optimized, high-volume production of these devices, and compared them to several other examples. The cost breakdown for electric machines in these reports included only the rotor, stator, and shaft and did not include supporting parts such as the housing, resolver, and mounts which the reports costed separately. In order to develop a total motor cost per kW that includes these components, we took an average of the share of the cost of these parts and determined that the cost of the stator, rotor and shaft should be multiplied by 1.1 (PMSM) and 1.3 (induction) to represent the total cost. By averaging the costs from the available sources that we considered to be the best examples of current technology, we arrived at a cost of $4.29 per kW for a PMSM electric machine, which represents the mean of the selected rotor/stator/shaft costs multiplied by 1.1 to account for the added cost of housing, resolver, and mounts. For induction motors, costs for the following components were available in these reports (Table 2-38). Table 2-38: Induction Motors Described in Munro Reports Induction motors kW Tesla 2020 Model Y AWD Perf - Front 158 Tesla 2018 Model 3 PremLR AWD - Front 147 Audi 2019 Audi e-tron - Front 141 Audi 2019 Audi e-tron - Rear 172 By the same process we arrived at a cost of $2.40 per kW for an induction machine, which represents the mean of the selected rotor/stator/shaft costs, multiplied by 1.3 to add the cost of the housing, resolver, and mounts. While developing these costs, EPA consulted informally with the Department of Energy Vehicle Technologies Office (DOE VTO) to compare the developing cost estimates with their perspectives on current and future cost expectations for EV components and to better interpret the existing USCAR cost targets for these components. With regard to the emerging cost estimates, they were seen as being consistent with general expectations between the consulting staff at the agencies. While some of the emerging costs for electric machines and various power electronics were somewhat higher than USCAR targets and others were lower, it was noted that the USCAR targets represent DOE's assessment of an attainable future cost at the time of their development in about 2017, and the fact that the merging costs were derived from teardown data from vehicles and components that were not available at the time would be expected to provide a reliable characterization of current day costs even if they deviated significantly from those targets."

These include inverters used for the traction motor (two versions, one in silicon IGBT form and another in silicon carbide), onboard charger, DC fast charging circuit, power management and distribution module, and DCDC converter. This section also describes the cost assumed for high voltage wiring. The primary sources for silicon IGBT inverter cost were the Munro teardown reports. We arrived at an averaged and rounded figure of $2.50 per kW for an IGBT inverter, based on these sources. EPA also considered an inverter based on a silicon carbide (SiC) design. A SiC inverter currently has a higher cost compared to silicon IGBT designs, but offers a higher switching frequency, which allows the inverter to operate at a higher efficiency. This makes it a particularly good fit for an induction motor, which has lower efficiency in some operating regions than the more costly PMSM machine. Based on consideration of the information available in the Munro teardowns, we arrived at an approximate cost of $4 per kW for a SiC inverter, and selected this design in configurations that employ an induction machine. Based on verbal conversations with Munro, we expect that the cost could be reduced sufficiently in the next five years to be comparable with the IGBT design, and so we consider this estimate to be conservative."

The cost difference to add AWD to a BEV with a PMSM already providing 2WD was thus taken to be the cost of a second motor (induction machine), a second inverter (SiC based to improve the efficiency of the induction motor), a second single-speed gear reduction, a second cooling loop to serve the second motor and inverter, and two additional half-shafts."

Some auto manufacturers are already doing so today. In order to potentially include an analysis of PHEVs for the final rule, EPA has developed powertrain costs for PHEV applications based primarily upon the costs developed for BEVs and HEVs in Chapter 2.6.1.3 and Chapter 2.6.1.2, respectively. PHEVspecific powertrain costs are subdivided into battery and non-battery costs. PHEV non-battery costs also include an ICE and a series/parallel hybrid transmission.

However, the agency recognizes that PHEVs can provide significant reductions in GHG emissions and that some vehicle manufacturers may choose to utilize this technology as part of their technology portfolio. As also described in Preamble IV.C.1, EPA has requested comment on the possibility of including modeling of PHEVs in the final rule analysis. In general, EPA anticipates that modeling of PHEVs in the final rule analysis would utilize power electronic costs, P4 gearbox costs and AWD costs based upon the BEV non-battery costs presented in Chapter 2.6.1.3.2. In addition, here we also present costs for a series/parallel hybrid transmission for PHEVs, consisting of: \u2022 Motor-generator \u2022 Starter-generator \u2022 Clutch-pack to lock the ICE and starter generator to the motor generator for parallel operation An example of such a series/parallel hybrid drive system for transverse front-drive applications is shown in Figure 2-25. Yamagishi and Ishikura provided a detailed description of application of a similar series/parallel drive system to the Honda Clarity PHEV (Yamagishi and Ishikura 2018). An application of this type of series/parallel drive to a front-engine/rear-drive application would require use of a drive shaft and separate, rear-mounted differential. AWD vehicles include the cost of a series/parallel hybrid transmission with the addition of a P4 electric machine to either the front or rear depending on the application. The full set of PHEV non-battery/non-ICE costs that could potentially be implemented in OMEGA in the final rule analysis is summarized in Table 2-40. An example of potential PHEV ICE costs is summarized in Table 2-41. The specific example used within the tables is an LDT4 with OMEGA size-class 7 vehicle with: \u2022 A combined electric drive system power of 240 kW \u2022 A P4 induction machine for front axle electric-only drive \u2022 A 3.0L Miller Cycle engine coupled to a series/parallel (S/P) drive single-speed transmission with a drive shaft and rear differential for rear axle drive Figure 2-28: An example of a series/parallel hybrid drive system for a transverse/frontdrive application with a portion of the outer casing and stators removed to show internal details.

Instead, OMEGA calculates mass based on the factors shown in Table 2-45, with the compliance strategy decision based primarily on steel versus aluminum structure. Footprint may also change which would impact the mass of the vehicle, but the mass associated with potential footprint changes is a secondary effect of the footprint decision. In other words, footprint does not change as a result of mass reduction strategies and, instead, mass may change as a result of footprint strategies.

As can be seen, there is a fairly even distribution of vehicle model redesign years. Note that many vehicles which were redesigned in MY 2026 were eligible for another redesign in MY 2031.

However, EPA notes that major manufacturers are already building a large amount of assembly plant manufacturing capacity both in the U.S. and abroad to meet future demand for these vehicles, and these efforts are poised to continue. Unlike critical minerals which have fundamental constraints on their production due to limited presence of these resources as well as a relatively long lead time for increasing their extraction, vehicle assembly capacity is a relatively well understood process that can respond relatively quickly to the necessary investment commitments. Given the existing activities among automakers in this area, and the relatively long lead time before MY 2027 when the proposed rule would begin, EPA did not specifically impose a limit on vehicle assembly capacity. However, as described in DRIA 3.1.3.2, EPA did represent a reasonable rate of battery manufacturing ramp-up by using information about battery manufacturing facilities announced or in operation, and estimates of lithium availability, to develop a constraint on annual GWh battery demand for use by OMEGA. For more discussion of manufacturing capacity and critical minerals, please see DRIA 3.1.3.1, DRIA 3.1.3.2, and Preamble IV.C.6."

                "content": " OMEGA explicitly accounts for two elements of the Inflation Reduction Act in compliance modeling: the battery production tax credit and the BEV purchase incentive. The IRS Section 45X battery production tax credit is treated within the modeling as a reduction in direct manufacturing costs, which in turn is assumed to result in a reduction in purchase price for the consumer after the application of the Retail Price Equivalent (RPE) factor. The credit phases out by statute from 2030 through 2032. As described previously in section 2.5.2.1.4, we estimated the average amount of the credit in 2023 at 60 percent of the maximum $45, and ramped the value upward linearly each year until it reaches the maximum $45 in 2027. For discussion of the justification of this choice, please see Section 2.5.2.1.4 and Preamble IV.C.2. The resulting value of the credit applied in OMEGA, in terms of dollars per kWh of gross battery capacity, is shown in Table 2-47. These represent an average credit amount across the industry as a whole. Although some manufacturers and vehicles may realize the full value of the credit in any given year, the model requires an average value across the full market. Table 2-49: IRA Battery Production Tax Credits in OMEGA Year Tax credit value ($/kWh) 2023 $27 2024 $31.50 2025 $36 2026 $40.50 2027 $45 2028 $45 2029 $45 2030 $33.75 2031 $22.50 2032 $11.25 2033 $0 The IRS 30D and 45W Clean Vehicle Credits are reflected in lower consumer purchase costs, and therefore have an influence on the shares of BEVs demanded by consumers. The reduction in costs for the consumer makes BEVs relatively more attractive than ICE alternatives, compared to the case with no purchase incentives. The purchase incentive is assumed to be realized entirely by the consumer and does not impact the producer generalized cost value or the manufacturing cost. While the restrictions imposed by the IRA on the 30D credit (income, MSRP, critical mineral content, and manufacturing content) limit the vehicles which are eligible for the full $7,500 incentive under 30D, we believe that manufacturers will work to increase the number of vehicles that qualify over time due to the high marketing value of the credit. Further, we expect that the IRS 45W Clean Commercial Vehicle Credit, which is not subject to many of the restrictions on the 30D credit, will likely impact a significant portion of BEV sales, through fleet purchases and also through vehicle leasing to consumers. For these reasons, we have conceptualized the purchase incentive as a combination of 30D and 45W credits. The OMEGA modeling ramps in the purchase incentive from $3,750 in MY2023 to a maximum of $6,000 in MY2027, as shown in Table 2-51. See also the discussion in Preamble IV.C.2. Table 2-50: IRS 30D and 45W Clean Vehicle Credit in OMEGA Model Year Combined BEV Purchase Incentive Value 2022 $0 2023 $3750 2024 $4000 2025 $4250 2026 $4500 2027 $4750 2028 $5000 2029 $5250 2030 $5500 2031 $5750 2032 $6000 2033 $0 "
