                "content": " Under an Interagency Agreement between EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy, NREL has continued its development of a suite of electric vehicle infrastructure modeling tools (EVI-X) and methods for simulating PEV charging infrastructure requirements and associated electricity loads from best available data. EVI-X tools have informed multiple national, state, and local PEV charging infrastructure planning studies (E. Wood, et al. 2017) (E. Wood, C. Rames, et al. 2018) (Alexander, et al. 2021), including a forthcoming national infrastructure assessment through 2030 (Wood, Borlaug, et al. 2023). As noted above, this infrastructure differs from that of electric power utility distribution system infrastructure. Within the emissions inventory analysis for the proposal, EVI-X models are used to translate scenario-specific forecasts of national light-duty vehicle stock and annual energy consumption from the OMEGA model into spatially disaggregated hourly load profiles required for subsequent power sector modeling using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) . The primary components of the process flow from OMEGA outputs to IPM inputs .

                "content": " As described in further detail in Chapter 2 of the DRIA, the OMEGA model evaluates the cost of compliance for meeting the standards and options analyzed within the proposed rule. Each OMEGA run produces scenario-specific projections of national vehicle sales, stock, energy consumption, and tailpipe emissions. For PEVs, however, tailpipe emissions are zero in the case of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and during the charge-depleting operation of plug-in hybrid electric (PHEVs) with resulting emissions occuring upstream at the electricity generation source, thus expanding the requisite analytical boundaries of the system with respect to determination of emissions inventory impacts. To produce estimates of the spatiotemporal charging loads needed for power sector emissions modeling, the national PEV stock from OMEGA must first be disaggregated regionally. The framework developed for PEV disaggregation leverages a likely adopter model (LAM) adapted by NREL (Ge, et al. 2021) to rank vehicles in the private light-duty fleet for their likelihood to be replaced by a PEV based on publicly available demographic data, including housing type, income, tenure (rent or own), state policies (ZEV states), and population density. The model is trained on the revealed preferences of 3,772 survey respondents (228 PEV owners) across the United States as described in (Ge, et al. 2021). Vehicle registration data from June 2022 (Experian 2022) were used to develop a set of chassis-specific LAMs for disaggregating PEV sedans, S/CUVs, pickups, and vans based on current regional vehicle type preferences. This process is outlined in Figure 2. Figure 5-2: Procedure for disaggregating OMEGA national PEV stock projections to IPM regions. Vehicles modeled within OMEGA were first assigned to a simplified chassis type (i.e., sedan, S/CUV, pickup, van). Next, the total number of vehicles in the simplified chassis types were used as inputs to each of the four chassis-specific LAMs to disaggregate PEVs into IPM regions based on regional vehicle type preferences and the likelihood of PEV adoption. The OMEGA model generates vehicle adoption projections for thousands of unique PEV models over time. Conducting detailed charging simulations for each of these models would be computationally prohibitive and produce results not expected to meaningfully differentiate from those generated by a reduced set of representative PEV models. Thus, a clustering approach was used to generate these representative PEV models for simulation from the complete set of OMEGA vehicles. K-means clustering was performed over each PEV\u2019s respective battery capacity (kWh) and energy consumption rate (kWh/mi.) parameters as specified by OMEGA. A silhouette analysis was used to determine the appropriate number of clusters (k=6 for BEVs, k=2 for PHEVs) and OMEGA vehicles were assigned to clusters that minimize the Euclidean distance to the centroids of the two normalized (Z-score) parameters. These assignments were retained and used to map OMEGA vehicles to the most similar synthetic representative PEV model. The cluster centroids were used to produce the battery capacity and energy consumption rate parameters for the eight representative PEVs required for subsequent PEV charging simulations. An additional parameter, the max DC charge acceptance, was defined as the maximum effective charging rate over a typical 20percent to 80percent SOC DC fast charge (DCFC) window. This was required to simulate DCFC for BEVs and was not directly specified by the OMEGA model. PHEVs were assumed to be incapable of using DCFC equipment. For modeling BEV DCFC, a simple heuristic was applied such that pre-2030 model years (Gen 1 batteries) would be capable of 1.5C charging while model year 2030 and after BEVs would be capable of charging at 3C (Gen 2 batteries).89 The key parameters for simulating charging for each of the representative PEVs are shown in Table 5-1. Three separate EVI-X models developed by NREL, namely EVI-Pro (for typical daily travel), EVI-RoadTrip (for long-distance travel), and EVI-OnDemand (for ride-hailing applications) 89 C-rate is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged/discharged relative to its maximum energy storage capacity. For example, 1.5C indicates that the battery is fully charged in 40 minutes, while 3C indicates a full charge in 20 minutes were used to estimate composite PEV charging load profiles under a unified set of assumptions: PEV fleet composition, regional home charging access (Ge, et al. 2021), regional weather conditions, public/workplace infrastructure availability, and charging preferences.  Figure 5-3 shows a schematic summary of the EVI-X models. The EVI-X models perform bottom-up simulations of charging behavior by superimposing the use of a PEV over travel data from internal combustion engine vehicles. These independent, but coordinated, simulations produce daily charging demands for typical PEV use, long-distance travel, and ride-hailing electrification, respectively, which are indexed in time (hourly over a representative 24-hr period for weekdays and weekends) and space (county). This process is shown in Figure 3 and described in (Wood, Borlaug, et al. 2023). Figure 5-3: EVI-X National light-duty vehicle framework simulation showing spatiotemporal energy demands for three separate use cases: typical daily travel (EVI-Pro), long-distance travel (EVI-RoadTrip), and ride-hailing (EVI-OnDemand). Following the PEV charging simulations, load profiles were aggregated from the county-level into IPM regions and converted from local time to Eastern Standard Time (EST) for IPM implementation. A final corrective step was taken to ensure that the annual energy consumption estimates supplied by OMEGA were reflected in the PEV load profiles. For a given OMEGA national PEV stock projection file, the modeling framework produces a typical weekday and weekend 24-hour (EST) load profile for all IPM regions (plus Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico) and analysis years (2026, 2028, 2030, 2032, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050, 2055). Load profiles were analyzed using output from four separate OMEGA analytical cases: 1) No-action Case: Vehicle electrification under the existing 2023 through 2026 light-duty vehicle GHG standards as represented by the standards finalized by EPA December 30, 2021 (86 FR 74434 2021), with updated OMEGA compliance modeling (see DRIA Chapter 2). 2) Action Case: Proposed light-and medium-duty vehicle standards 3) High BEV Sensitivity Case 4) Low BEV Sensitivity Case These analytical cases are described in more detail below. Figure 5-4 provides an example of how specific load profiles may be used to infer annual PEV charging demands for 2030 and 2050 using an example OMEGA analytical scenario (the \"Action Case\"). Figure 5-4: Annual PEV charging loads (2030 and 2050 are shown) for each IPM region in the contiguous United States based on OMEGA charge demand for the proposal in 2030 (top) and 2050 (bottom). In addition to the total hourly energy demands for PEV charging, energy demands were also broken out by the following charger types \u2013 home Level 1 (L1), home Level 2 (L2), work L2, public L2, and public DCFC (Figure 5-5). See section 5.3.1.2. for additional discussion. Note that these have been converted to EST and reflect an unmanaged charging scenario where drivers do not prioritize charging at certain times of the day (i.e., charging starts as soon as possible when vehicles are plugged in without consideration of electricity price or other factors). In Figure 5-5, there are clear differences in the magnitude, shape, and charger types between the West Texas (left\u2013ERC_WEST, containing mostly rural areas and small cities such as Midland and Odessa) and East Texas (right\u2013ERC_REST, including multiple major population centers such as Houston, San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas-Ft. Worth) regions. The EVI-X National light-duty vehicle framework conducts charging simulations that are reflective of the regional differences in EV adoption, vehicle type preferences, home ownership, weather conditions, and travel patterns. These demonstrative results reflect how in ERC_WEST, EV adoption is projected to be low (due to limited population and revealed vehicle preferences) leading to a reduced demand for home-based charging while public DCFC demands for longdistance travel across the region (e.g., road trips) are amplified. This leads to a disproportionate share of public DCFC charging demand along highway corridors within the ERC_WEST region. Alternatively, simulated charging demands in the ERC_REST are dominated by home and workplace charging due to the higher EV adoption and urban travel patterns more common to the region. The OMEGA national PEV outputs and the resulting regionalized IPM inputs from EVI-X for each of the four analyzed cases, for each IPM region and all analytical years (2026, 2028, 2030, 2032, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050, 2055) are summarized within a separate PEV Regionalized Charge Demand Report (McDonald 2023). Figure 5-5: Yearly hourly (in EST) weekday and weekend load profiles for two IPM regions (ERC_WEST, west Texas; and ERC_REST, east Texas) broken out by charger type for an example OMEGA analytical scenario."

This model was developed by ICF a under contract with EPA (ICF 2019). IPM includes a wholesale electric power market model that projects wholesale prices paid to generators. Electricity consumers\u2014industrial, commercial, and residential customers\u2014face a retail price for electricity that is higher than the wholesale price because it includes the cost of wholesale power and the costs of transmitting and distributing electricity to end-use consumers. The RPM was developed to estimate retail prices of electricity based on outputs of EPA\u2019s Base Case using IPM and a range of other assumptions, including the method of regulation and pricesetting in each state. Traditionally, cost-of-service (COS) or Rate-of-Return regulation sets rates based on the estimated average costs of providing electricity to customers plus a \u201cfair and equitable return\u201d to the utility\u2019s investors. States that impose cost-of-service regulation typically have one or more investor-owned utilities (IOUs), which own and operate their own generation, transmission, and distribution assets. They are also the retail service provider for their franchised service territory in which IOUs operates. Under this regulatory structure, retail power prices are based on average historical costs and are established for each class of service by state regulators during periodic rate case proceedings.

The RPM was developed by ICF for EPA (ICF 2019) and uses the IPM estimates of changes in the cost of generating electricity to estimate the changes in average retail electricity prices. The prices are average prices over consumer classes (i.e., consumer, commercial, and industrial) and regions, weighted by the amount of electricity used by each class and in each region. The RPM combines the IPM annual cost estimates in each of the 74 IPM regions with EIA electricity market data for each of the 25 NERC/ISO90 electricity supply subregions (Table (NEMS) (U.S. Energy Information Administraton 2019). Table 5-4 summarizes the projected percentage changes in the retail price of electricity for the proposal versus a no-action case, respectively. Consistent with other projected impacts presented above, average retail electricity price differences at the national level are projected to be small at less than 1percent difference in 2030 and 2050. Regional average retail electricity price differences showed small increases or decreases (less than approximately 1 to 2percent) with the sole exception of PJMC, which is the PJM Commonwealth Edison (Metropolitan Chicago) NERC/ISO subregion.

These power plants are referred to here collectively as Electric Generating Units (EGU). This definition includes all types of generating facilities (e.g. fossil fuel-fired combustion, nuclear, hydroelectric, renewable, etc.). This modeling reveals anticipated EGU retirements, EGU retrofits, and new EGU construction, which are discussed below. EGUs are retired by IPM when announced by their owner and for economic reasons. The IRA and BIL resulted in many EGU retirements. As such, the number and types of EGU retirements associated with the proposed rule when compared to a no-action case are small in comparison to those retirements that occurred as a result of the IRA and BIL.

EGU retirements modelled by IPM for the no-action and for the proposal are summarized in , respectively. Incremental EGU retirements and incremental new modeled EGU capacity are summarized in Table 5-10 and Table 5-11, respectively.

While it is less common to refer to the place home charging occurs (e.g., garage or driveway) as a station, we use the term ports in the same way for residential and non-residential charging. It must be noted that charging infrastructure is different from the electric power utility distribution system infrastructure, which is comprised of distribution feeder circuits, switches, protective equipment, primary circuits, distribution transformers, secondaries, service drops, etc. The electric power utility distribution system infrastructure typically ends at a service drop (i.e. the run of cables from the electric power utility's distribution power lines to the point of connection to a customer's premises)."

Common AC charging types include L1 (up to about 2 kW power) and L2 (up to 19.2 kW power) (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023a) (Schey, Chu and Smart 2022). DC fast charging (DCFC) is available in a range of power levels today, e.g., 50 kW to 350 kW with standards for even higher-powered DCFC such as the Megawatt Charging System (MCS) currently in development (CharIN e.V. 2022). 91 Definitions are consistent with those used by (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023a). A diagram is available at: https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure.html (last accessed March 8, 2023). Generally, the use of higher-power EVSE ports corresponds to faster charging92 though the maximum power that vehicles can accept varies by model.93 Wireless or inductive charging systems have also been demonstrated and sold as aftermarket add-ons but have not been widely deployed (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023a). Due to the uncertainty about the timing and uptake of wireless charging, we consider it outside the scope of this analysis."

As shown in Figure 5-13, there are more than 50,000 nonresidential charging stations in the U.S. today with over 140,000 EVSE ports.95 This is an increase from just over 85,000 EVSE ports as of the end of 2019. These include public EVSE ports, as well as some private ports, e.g., at workplaces or for fleet use. About 80 percent of EVSE ports today are L2, however, DCFC deployments have generally experienced faster growth than L2 in the past few years (Brown, et al. 2022). Among DCFC, there is a trend toward higher power levels with more than half of the EVSE ports over 50 kW and 10 percent at 300 kW or more as of the first quarter of 2021 (U.S. Department of Energy 2021). 160,000 - 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 140,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 EVSE Ports Stations 92 For example, DCFC can add 200 miles or more of range per hour of charging compared to about 25 miles for L2, depending on power levels (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023a). 93 Table 5-1 shows the maximum DCFC power levels we assumed for BEV models in our infrastructure cost analysis. 94 As used herein, \"charging infrastructure\" refers to EVSE, which is not a part of electric utility distribution infrastructure, which is comprised of distribution feeder circuits, switches, protective equipment, primary circuits, distribution transformers, secondaries, service drops, etc. The electric power utility distribution system infrastructure typically ends at a service drop (i.e. the run of cables from the electric power utility's distribution power lines to the point of connection to a customer's premises). 95 These counts may include a small number of EVSE ports and stations at multifamily housing.

Wood, et al. 2017) and ATLAS (McKenzie and Nigro 2021)96. For example, the NREL study estimated a need for 1.8 DCFC ports for every thousand PEVs on the road, while Atlas estimated the need for 4.7 DCFC ports per thousand PEVs. By mid-2022, there were 9.2 DCFC ports per thousand PEVs,97 well above the projected needs estimated by these studies (Brown, et al. 2022). By mid- 2022, there were also 40 public and workplace L2 ports for every thousand PEVs on the road. This is similar to the 40.1 NREL estimated will be needed, and significantly higher than the 5.8 L2 ports per thousand PEVs that Atlas estimated (Brown, et al. 2022). Of course, keeping up with charging needs as PEV adoption grows will require continued expansion of, and investment in, charging infrastructure."

According to BloombergNEF, annual global investment was $62 billion in 2022, nearly twice that of the prior year, and while about 10 years was needed for cumulative global investment to total $100 billion, $200 billion could be reached in just three more years (BloombergNEF 2023). This growth was also seen in U.S. infrastructure spending. Combined investments in hardware and installation for U.S. home and public charging ports was over $1.2 billion in 2021, nearly a three-fold increase from 2017 (BloombergNEF 2022). The U.S. government is making large investments in infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (Public Law 117-58 2021) and the Inflation Reduction Act (Public Law 117- 169 2022). However, we expect that private investments will also play a critical role in meeting future infrastructure needs. Private charging companies have already attracted billions globally in venture capital and mergers and acquisitions (Hampleton 2023). In the U.S., there was $200 million or more in mergers and acquisition activity in 2022 according to the capital market data provider PitchBook (St. John and Naughton 2022), indicating strong interest in the future of the charging industry. Bain projects that by 2030, the U.S. market for electric vehicle charging will be \"large and profitable\" with both revenue and profits estimated to grow by a factor of twenty relative to 2021 (Zayer, et al. 2022).98 Domestic manufacturing capacity is also increasing with over $600 million in announced investments to support the production of charging equipment and components at existing or new U.S. facilities. (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023) (Kempower 2023). These activities along with the large variety of private investments 96 NREL and ATLAS both assessed future charging infrastructure needs, but under different PEV adoption scenarios.

Two-thirds of this funding is for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2022a). The remaining $2.5 billion is for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program, which is evenly divided between funds for charging and fueling infrastructure along corridors and in communities where fueling infrastructure can include hydrogen, propane, or natural gas (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2022a). These programs are administered under the Federal Highway Administration with support from the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. The first phase of NEVI formula funding for states was launched in 2022 and is focused on building out Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs) on highways. Charging stations for AFCs are required to have at least four DCFC ports, each 150 kW or higher (88 FR 12724 2023). Per FHWA's guidance to states, stations generally must be located no more than 50 miles apart and one mile from the Interstate (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2022a). Initial plans for all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico covering FY22 and FY23 funds were approved in September 2022. Together the $1.5 billion in funding will help deploy or expand charging infrastructure on about 75,000 miles of highway (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2022b). In March 2023, the first funding opportunity was opened under the CFI Program with up to $700 million to deploy PEV charging and hydrogen, propane, or natural gas fueling infrastructure in communities and along corridors (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023b). In addition to NEVI, there are a variety of other Federal programs that could help reduce State or private costs associated with deploying EVSE. For example, constructing and installing charging infrastructure is an eligible activity for other U.S. Department of Transportation formula programs including the Congestion Mitigation & Air Quality Improvement Program, National Highway Performance Program, and Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, which have a total of more than $40 billion in FY22 funds authorized under the BIL (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2022a).100 Discretionary grant programs include the Rural Surface Transportation Grant Program, Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Grant Program, and the Discretionary Grant Program for Charging and Refueling Infrastructure (U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 2022a). 99 Signed into law as the \"Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\" 100 Only a portion is likely to be used to support PEV charging infrastructure, and limits and restrictions may apply."

Several states including New Jersey and Utah offer partial rebates for residential, workplace, or public charging while others such as Georgia and D.C. offer tax credits (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023c).101 The NC Clean Energy Technology Center identified more than 200 actions taken across 38 states and D.C. related to providing financial incentives for electric vehicles and or charging infrastructure in 2022, a four-fold increase over the number of actions in 2017 (Apadula, et al. 2023).102 The Edison Electric Institute estimates that electric 101 Details on eligibility, qualifying expenses, and rebate or tax credit amounts vary by state. 102 Includes actions by states and investor-owned utilities. companies have already invested nearly $3.7 billion (EEI 2023).103 And over 60 electric companies and cooperatives serving customers in 48 states and the District of Columbia have joined together to advance fast charging through the National Electric Highway Coalition (EEI 2023). Auto manufacturers are investing in charging infrastructure by offering consumers help with costs to install home charging or providing support for public charging. For example, GM will pay for a standard installation of a Level 2 (240 V) outlet for customers purchasing or leasing a new Bolt (Chevrolet 2023). GM is also partnering with charging provider EVgo to deploy over 2,700 DCFC ports and charging provider FLO to deploy as many as 40,000 L2 ports (GM 2021) (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023). Volkswagen, Hyundai, and Kia all offer customers complimentary charging at Electrify America's public charging stations (subject to time limits or caps) in conjunction with the purchase of select new electric vehicle models (VW 2023) (Hyundai 2023) (Kia 2023). Ford has agreements with several charging providers to make it easier for their customers to charge and pay across different networks (Ford 2019) and plans to install publicly accessible DCFC ports at nearly 2,000 dealerships (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023). Mercedes-Benz recently announced that it is planning to build 2,500 charging points in North America by 2027 (Reuters 2023). Tesla has its own network with over 17,000 DCFC ports and nearly 10,000 L2 ports in the United States (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023d). Tesla recently announced that by 2024, 7,500 or more existing and new ports (including 3,500 DCFC) would be open to all PEVs (The White House 2023). Other charging networks are also expanding. Francis Energy, which has fewer than 1000 EVSE ports today (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023d), aims to deploy over 50,000 by the end of the decade (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023). Electrify America plans to more than double its network size (U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuels Data Center 2023d) to 10,000 fast charging ports across 1800 U.S. and Canadian stations by 2026. This is supported in part by a $450 million investment from Siemens and Volkswagen Group (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023). Blink plans to invest over $60 million to grow its network over the next decade. Charging companies are also partnering with major retailers, restaurants, and other businesses to make charging available to customers and the public. For example, EVgo is deploying DCFC at certain Meijer locations, CBL properties, and Wawa. Volta is installing DCFC and L2 ports at select Giant Food, Kroger, and Stop and Shop stores, while ChargePoint and Volvo Cars are partnering with Starbucks to make charging available at select Starbucks locations (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023). Other efforts will expand charging access along major highways at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J travel centers (through a partnership between Pilot, GM and EVgo) and 200 TravelCenters of America and Petro locations (through a partnership between TravelCenters of America and Electrify America). BP plans to invest $1 billion toward charging infrastructure by the end of the decade, including through a partnership to provide charging at various Hertz locations across the country that could support rental and ridesharing vehicles, taxis, and the public (Joint Office of Energy and Transportation 2023). 103 The $3.7 billion total includes infrastructure deployments and other customer programs to advance transportation electrification."

NREL's EVI-X modeling suite was used, including the EVI-Pro model to simulate charging demand from typical daily travel, EVIRoadTrip to simulate demand from long-distance travel, and EVI-OnDemand to simulate demand from ride-hailing applications. Eight unique charging types and locations were considered: home L1, home L2, work L2, public L2, and public DCFC at 50 kW, 150 kW, 250 kW, and 350 kW power levels (DC-50, DC-150, DC-250, and DC-350). The following assumptions informed the respective charging shares for daily travel modeled with EVI-Pro: \u2022 PEVs with access to residential charging are assumed to prefer home over either work or public charging when home charging is sufficient to support all travel needs. \u2022 75 percent of BEVs and 53 percent of PHEVs are assumed to use L2 for home charging with the remaining share using L1.104 \u2022 Workplace L2 is the next most preferred charging type after home charging. \u2022 Remaining charging needs are met with public charging. DCFC is generally preferred for BEVs, and among DCFC, the highest power that a vehicle can accept (or \"as fast as possible\" charging) is preferred. \u2022 Public L2 charging is used by PHEVs, which are assumed not to be DCFC-capable. It's also used by BEVs in certain long dwell time location types such as schools or medical facilities where it's assumed that DCFC is not available. For road trips and travel by ride-hailing vehicles modeled in EVI-RoadTrip and EVIOnDemand respectively, all public charging is assumed to be met with DCFC for BEVs. 104 This in part reflects assumptions about the characteristics of PEVs modeled by OMEGA, including a percentage of low mileage PEVs for which L1 meets daily charging needs. Additionally, BEVs able to accept higher-power charging (Gen 2) are assumed to be adopted more quickly for these applications than for daily travel needs modeled in EVI-Pro.105 As shown in Figure 5-14, the share of PEV charging demand by location and type is similar for the proposal and no-action case. The majority of PEV charging is home L2 across all years though the share under the proposal declines from over 70 percent in 2028 to just below 60 percent in 2055 as the share of workplace and public charging grow. DCFC has the next highest share of demand. Due to the modeling assumption that BEVs charge \"as fast as possible\" when using DCFC, 350 kW charging dominates. Since simulated BEV models are capable of higherpower charging, no DC-50 kW charging is found for either the proposal or no-action case.

                "content": " The number of EVSE ports needed to meet the level of PEV charging demand in our proposal and in the no-action case was estimated for all charging types described above. Home charging was further delineated into charging at single family houses (SFHs)\u2015including both detached and attached houses (e.g., townhouses) \u2015 and non-SFHs which include apartments, condos, and mobile homes. Several additional assumptions informed this network sizing. For home charging, it was assumed that as PEV adoption increases, more home charging ports would be shared across vehicles. This could reflect SFHs with more than one PEV or residents of multiunit dwellings that share L2 ports. Specifically, we assume that at 1 percent PEV adoption, 1 EVSE port is needed per PEV with home charging access. This declines to 0.6 EVSE ports per 105 For max DC fast charging rates for different vehicle types modeled in this analysis, see Table 5-1. PEV for SFHs and 0.5 EVSE ports per PEV for other home types when PEVs make up the entire light-duty fleet. Network sizing for public and workplace charging is based on the regional charging load profiles described in Chapter 5.1. For each DCFC port type (DC-50, DC-150, DC-250, and DC- 350), the total number of ports needed is scaled such that during the peak hour of usage 20 percent of ports in the region are fully utilized. For work and public L2 charging, 43 percent of ports are assumed to be fully utilized during the peak hour. These percentages are modeled after highly utilized stations today (Wood, Borlaug, et al. 2023). 106 Figure 5-15 and Figure 5-16 show the growing charging network that may be needed to meet PEV charging demand in the proposal and no-action case respectively.107 We anticipate that the highest number of ports will be needed at homes, growing from under 12 million in 2027 to over 75 million in 2055 under the proposal.108 This is followed by workplace charging, estimated at about 400,000 EVSE ports in 2027 and over 12.7 million in 2055. Finally, public charging needs grow from just over 110,000 ports to more than 1.9 million in that timeframe. Notably, while DCFC at 350 kW constitutes a significant fraction of total electricity demand (Figure 13), the number of ports needed is relatively small compared to the scale shown. This is because far fewer 350 kW ports are needed to deliver the same amount of electricity as lower-powered options. Similar patterns are observed in the no-action case\u2015though fewer total ports are needed than under the proposal due to the lower anticipated PEV demand. 106 The same method and thresholds for sizing the non-residential charging network based on peak hour of usage was applied for all years in this analysis. If we instead assumed the percentage of L2 or DCFC ports that are fully utilized at peak grew as a function of time or PEV penetration, we would expect higher average utilizations per port and fewer total ports needed. 107 Charging simulations were conducted for 2026, 2028, 2030, 2032, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050, and 2055. Linear interpolations were used to estimate the network size in intermediate years. Estimates above do not include PEV charging demand for medium-duty or heavy-duty vehicles. 108 The number of EVSE ports needed to meet a given level of electricity demand will vary based on the mix of charging ports, charging preferences, and other factors. Estimates shown reflect assumptions specific to this analysis, but actual needs could vary.

In order to estimate the costs incurred each year, we calculate how many EVSE ports of each type would need to be procured and installed to achieve the charging network sizes shown in Figure 5-15 and Figure 5-16. There is limited data on the expected lifespan and maintenance needs of PEV charging infrastructure. We make the simplifying assumption that all EVSE ports have a 15-year equipment lifetime (Borlaug, Salisbury, et al. 2020). After that, we assume they must be replaced at full cost. This assumption likely overestimates costs as some EVSE providers may opt to upgrade existing equipment rather than incur the cost of a full replacement. Some installation costs such as trenching or electrical upgrades may also not be needed for the replacement. We do not attempt to estimate EVSE maintenance costs due to uncertainty but note that maintenance may be able to extend equipment lifetimes.

There are many factors that can impact equipment costs, including whether ports are wall-mounted or on a pedestal as well as differences in equipment features and capabilities (Schey, Chu and Smart 2022). For example, an ICCT paper found that costs more than doubled between networked and non-networked L2 hardware (Nicholas, Estimating electric vehicle charging infrastructure costs across major U.S. metropolitan areas 2019). Among networked units with one or two ports per pedestal, about a 10 percent difference in per-port hardware costs was found (Nicholas, Estimating electric vehicle charging infrastructure costs across major U.S. metropolitan areas 2019). The power level of the EVSE is one of the most significant drivers of cost differences. While estimates for charging equipment vary across the literature, higher-power charging equipment is typically more expensive than lower-power units. Installation costs may include labor, materials (e.g., wire or conduit), permitting, taxes, and upgrades or modifications to the on-site electrical service. These costs\u2015particularly labor and permitting\u2015can vary widely by region (Schey, Chu and Smart 2022). They also vary by site. For example, how much trenching is needed will depend on the distance from where the charging equipment will be located and the electrical panel. A recent study found that average L2 installation costs at condominiums and commercial locations increased by $16 or $20 for each extra foot of distance between the EVSE and power source respectively (Schey, Chu and Smart 2022). How many EVSE ports are installed also impacts cost. ICCT estimated that on a per-port basis, installation costs for 150 kW ports were about 2.5 times higher when only one port is installed compared to 6\u250020 per site (Nicholas, Estimating electric vehicle charging infrastructure costs across major U.S. metropolitan areas 2019). And, as with hardware costs, installation costs may rise with power levels. To reflect the diversity of hardware and installation costs, we considered a range of costs for each charging type as shown in Table 5-10 and detailed below.109 Table 5-14: Cost (hardware and installation) per EVSE port110 Home Work Public 109 All costs shown above and used within the cost analysis are rounded to the nearest hundred. 110 Costs shown are expressed in 2019 dollars, consistent with the original sources from the literature.

For example, hardware costs could decrease due to manufacturing learning and economies of scale. Recent studies by ICCT assumed a 3 percent annual reduction in hardware costs (Nicholas, Estimating electric vehicle charging infrastructure costs across major U.S. metropolitan areas 2019) (Bauer, Hsu, et al., Charging Up America: Assessing the Growing Need for U.S. Charging Infrastructure Through 2030 2021). By contrast, installation costs could increase due to growth in labor or material costs. As noted above, installation costs also depend on site conditions, including whether sufficient electric capacity exists to add charging infrastructure and how much trenching is required between the EVSE port and electrical panel. If easier and, therefore, lower cost sites are selected first, then over time installation costs could rise as charging stations start to be installed in more challenging locations. (Bauer, Hsu, et al., Charging Up America: Assessing the Growing Need for U.S. Charging Infrastructure Through 2030 2021) found that these and other countervailing factors could result in the average cost of a 150 kW EVSE port in 2030 being similar (~3 percent lower) to that in 2021. Due to the uncertainty on how costs may change over time, we have made the simplifying assumption for this analysis to keep combined hardware and installation costs per EVSE port constant."

We take the average as a simplifying assumption but continue to monitor the literature for costs associated with this power level. some cases require upgrades to local distribution systems. For example, a recent study found power needs as low as 200 kW could trigger the need to install a distribution transformer while a load of 5 MW or more could require upgrades to feeder circuits or the addition of a feeder breaker (Borlaug, Muratori, et al. 2021). There are a variety of approaches that could reduce the need or scale of such upgrades\u2014 potentially saving both cost and deployment time. For example, distribution system capacity and interconnection could be factored into the site selection process, and when possible, utilities could work with station developers to evaluate multiple potential sites before a selection is made (Hernandez 2022). Another emerging best practice identified by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council is for utilities to provide hosting capacity maps (HCMs) that identify grid capacity constraints (Hernandez 2022). Such maps could help developers determine whether area feeders or substations have additional capacity for charging or other loads. By mid-2022, requirements for HCMs or related analyses were in place in ten states identified by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Schwartz 2022). More broadly, 25 states and the District of Columbia have ongoing efforts and requirements to support proactive distribution system planning and grid modernization (Schwartz 2022). Managing the additional demand from PEV charging is another key strategy. Automated load management or power control systems are being explored as a way to dynamically limit total charging load and ensure it doesn't exceed available capacity\u2015potentially reducing the need for upgrades at some sites (Nuvve and Enel X 2020) (BATRIES 2023). The use of onsite battery storage and renewables may also be able to reduce demand on the grid, and some station operators may opt for these technologies to mitigate demand charges associated with peak power (Alexander, et al. 2021). In addition, managed or smart charging can be used in some cases to reduce power or shift charging demand to times when it is easier to meet. Charging equipment funded under the NEVI Formula Program, or as part of publicly-accessible charging projects funded under Title 23, U.S.C., must be capable of smart charge management (88 FR 12724 2023).118 Finally, we note that an adapter developed by Argonne National Laboratory to retrofit non-networked L2 EVSE to allow load management and other smart charging capabilities is in the process of being commercialized (EVmatch, Inc. 2023). (Also see the discussion of managed charging and vehicle-grid integration in Chapter 5.4 below.) Innovative charging approaches may also reduce the need for upgrades in certain cases, or otherwise reduce infrastructure costs. Mobile charging units could be a solution for locations like parking garage decks in which it is challenging or costly to install EVSE ports (Alexander, et al. 2021), or be used as a temporary solution while stations are being built. These units are available in a variety of power levels (e.g., the dual-port Mobi EV charger by (FreeWire Technologies 2023) can provide up to 11 kW while the Lightning Mobile unit can be configured to have up to five 80 kW DCFC ports (Lightning eMotors 2023)), and can be recharged at times and locations in which there is sufficient electrical capacity. Standalone charging canopies with integrated 118 The National Electric Vehicle Standards and Requirements Final Rule establishes requirements for standardized communication among vehicles, charging equipment, and networks to ensure interoperability. Specifically, the use of ISO 15118 is required for communication between vehicles and chargers, Open Charge Point Protocol for communication between chargers and networks, and Open Charge Point Interface for communication among charging networks. (See (88 FR 12724 2023) for details on applicable versions and the timing for these requirements.) solar cells and battery storage that don't need to be connected to the grid (Alexander, et al. 2021) may be useful for remote locations or where construction is costly or difficult. There is considerable uncertainty associated with future distribution upgrade needs as well as with the uptake of the technologies and approaches discussed above that could reduce upgrade costs, and we do not model them directly as part of our infrastructure cost analysis.119"

                "content": " How the additional electricity demand from PEVs will impact the grid will depend on many factors including the time-of-day that charging occurs, and the use of battery storage and vehicleto- grid (V2G) or other Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) technology. For example, PEVs can be scheduled to charge at off-peak hours when the electricity demand is easier to meet. Onsite battery storage, if deployed at charging stations, could also reduce potential grid impacts by shifting when electricity is drawn from the grid while still providing power to vehicles when needed. Managed charging and battery storage could also enable increasing renewable use if charging load is shifted to times with excess solar or wind that might otherwise be curtailed. V2G technology, which allows electricity to be drawn from vehicles when not in use, could even allow PEVs to enhance grid reliability. Electric power system reliability can be determined using a variety of statistical metrics. The generally accepted metrics by which electric utilities across the U.S. measure and report electric power system reliability is set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) using the standard IEEE 1366-2022 (IEEE Guide for Electric Power Distribution Reliability Indices). The formulation of overall electric power system reliability metrics includes electric power outages associated with what is known as \u201closs of supply\u201d events; these are events in which electric power generation and/or electric power transmission is the root cause for a power outage. As this discussion is limited to electric power distribution system reliability, an electric power system reliability metric that excludes electric power outages associated with the loss of supply events (i.e. loss of electric power generation and/or electric power transmission) is appropriate. Using this approach, we observed that electric power utilities in 48 U.S. Census Division and State regions tracked by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) had overall trends in distribution grid reliability that were less than the national average for the years 2013 and 2021 (the most-recent years for which data is available) (EIA, 2022). Conversely, 13 U.S. Census Division and State regions had overall trends in distribution grid reliability for the same years that were greater than the national average for the years in question. According to the California Public Utilities Commission, \"This data alone does not fully capture the current state of reliability of the U.S. electric power distribution system\u2026\" (Enis 2021). Given the massive size of the electric power distribution system \u2013 with its multitude of regional, climate, and density variations \u2013 interpreting distribution system reliability indices can be challenging to interpret. Moreover, such reliability statistics focus on outage duration and customer counts, which may obscure important regional variations. However, as the expected increase in electricity generation associated with the proposal relative to a no action case is relatively small \u2013 approximately 4.4 percent increase in 2050 \u2013 we do not expect the U.S. electric power distribution system to be adversely affected by the projected additional number of charging electric vehicles. Grid reliability is not expected to be adversely affected by the modest increase in electricity demand associated with electric vehicle charging. As shown in Figure 5-8, we project the additional generation needed to meet the demand of PEVs in the proposal to be relatively modest compared to the no-action case, ranging from less than 0.4percent in 2030 to approximately 4.4percent in 2050. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) (California Public Utilities Commission 2022) and the California Energy Commission (CEC) (Lipman, Harrington and Langton 2021) (Chhaya, et al. 2019) have been actively engaged in VGI121 efforts for over a decade, along with the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) (California Independent System Operator 2014, California Energy Commission; California Public Utilities Commission; Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development 2021), large private and public electrical utilities (SCE, PG&E, SDG&E, etc.), several automakers (Ford, GM, FCA, BMW, Audi, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, and others), and EV charger companies, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and various other research organizations. These efforts (Lipman, Harrington and Langton 2021) demonstrated the ability to shift up to 20 percent of electric vehicle charging loads in any given hour to other times of the day as well as the ability to add up to 30 percent of electric vehicle charging loads in a given hour (Lipman, Harrington and Langton 2021). We anticipate similar strategies could be used to shift PEV charging loads from peak times as needed to reduce grid impacts across different regions. As the expected increase in electric power demand resulting from PEV charging in this proposal will be well-under 20 percent, we do not anticipate it to pose grid reliability issues. The increasing integration of electric vehicle charging into the electric power grid has also been found to increase grid reliability (Chhaya, et al. 2019) , as the ability to shift and curtail electric power loads improves grid operations and, therefore, grid reliability. Such integration has been found to create value for electric vehicle drivers, electric grid operators, and ratepayers. Management of PEV charging can reduce overall costs to utility ratepayers by delaying electric utility customer rate increases associated with equipment upgrades and may allow utilities to use electric vehicle charging as a resource to manage intermittent renewables or provide ancillary services. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)122, is undertaking a three year-long research project to better-understand the scale of commitment and investment in the electric power grid that is required to meet the anticipated electric power loads. Thus far, the electric power sector and its regulators have focused on incremental EV load growth and charger utilization (Electric Power Research Institute 2022). The work of EPRI focuses on grid impacts and associated lead times required to better-prepare the grid (including transmission, substation, feeder, and transformer) for vehicle electrification. These efforts are, in part, based upon grid reliability research conducted by EPRI (Maitra 2013) (Electric Power Research Institute 2012), which identified grid and charging behavior characteristics associated with grid resiliency. We also consulted with FERC staff on distribution system reliability and related issues. State government plays an important role in vehicle electrification (including aspects of grid resilience), as most electric utilities are regulated by state Public Service Commissions (PSC) and Public Utility Commissioners (PUC) and since Federal funding for vehicle electrification is largely distributed through state agencies. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), a national association representing the state public service commissioners who regulate essential utility services, including energy, telecommunications, and 121 VGI is also sometimes referred to as Vehicle-to-Grid or VTG or V2G. 122 EPRI is an independent, nonprofit, U.S.-based organization that conducts research and development related to the generation, delivery, and use of electricity [https://www.epri.com/]. water, produced a series of documents aimed at providing vehicle electrification-related guidance for state regulators (National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners 2022a), facilitating electric vehicle interoperability (National Association of Regulatory Utility Commisioners 2022b), and fostering vehicle electrification equity (National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners 2022c). NARUC, in conjunction with the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), also produced a guide for public utility commissions, state energy offices, and departments of transportation discussing the state-level roles and their interrelations vis-\u00e0-vis transportation electrification (National Council on Electricity Policy, National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners 2022). We also note that DOE is engaged in multiple efforts to modernize the grid and improve resilience and reliability. For example, in November 2022, DOE announced $13 billion in funding opportunities under BIL to support transmission and distribution infrastructure. This includes $3 billion for smart grid grants with a focus on PEV integration among other topics (U.S. Department of Energy 2022). "
