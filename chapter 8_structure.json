This section describes the modeled changes to onroad emissions from light- and medium-duty vehicles, as well as modeled emission changes from \"upstream\" sectors like electricity generating units (EGUs) and refineries. Emission inventories for unchanging sectors are detailed in the air quality modeling technical support document (AQM TSD). (US EPA 2023) For this analysis, air quality modeling was performed for a 2016 base case, a 2055 reference case, and a 2055 light- and medium duty vehicle (LMDV) regulatory case.

Here we use the observed reduction in EC to determine the reduction fraction for the MOVES EC pollutant. We use the observed OC reduction as the reduction fraction to apply to the MOVES NonECPM pollutant. OC is not identical to NonECPM because OC measurements do not include information about other elemental components of the particulate matter such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and metallic ash components. For modeling purposes, we assume that the other components of non-elemental PM are filtered by the GPF in the same proportion as the OC part. The reduction factors for the start operating modes come from the study's 25\u00b0C FTP cycle tests. For running emissions excluding MOVES operating modes 30 and 40, the reduction factors come from averaging the results of the 60mph and HWFET tests. The reduction fractions for operating modes 30 and 40 are from the US06 test. Finally, to avoid computational issues that arise from setting emission factors to zero, reductions originally reported as 100% were adjusted to 99.9%. The final PM reductions by operating mode are summarized in Table 8-1 below 152 While GPFs are relevant only for gasoline and E85 vehicles, in MOVES, the emission rates for light-duty gasoline vehicles are replicated to represent light-duty diesel.

These are sources that change between the reference and LMDV regulatory case and are not onroad. The EGU emissions were modeled without including impacts from the IRA, and thus are larger than what we would expect if the IRA generation mix updates were included in the reference case. In 2055, total upstream emissions in the LMDV regulatory case would be between 0.3% and 4.4% higher, depending on the pollutant, than the reference. This increase is driven by the increase in emissions from EGUs, but there are also increased emissions projected from natural gas production well sites and pipeline pumps, due to a projected increase in natural gas fueled EGUs. We also project a small decrease in emissions from refineries and crude production wells and pipeline pumps due to assumed activity decreases at refineries related to a decrease in demand for liquid fuels for light- and medium-duty vehicles. Table 8-3 presents the net impact of these emissions increases and decreases.  There is uncertainty about the impact of reduced demand for petroleum fuels on refinery activity and emissions. For instance, refineries might export the volumes of gasoline and diesel fuel that would otherwise have been consumed in light- and medium-duty vehicles, absent this rulemaking. The illustrative air quality analysis assumes a decrease in refining activity in response to the reduced domestic demand for liquid fuels; however, Table 8-4 presents the net upstream emissions impacts if we had assumed no decrease in refinery activity.

The ambient air quality observations are average conditions, on a site-by-site basis, for a period centered around the model base year (i.e., 2014- 2018). The projected annual PM2.5 concentrations were calculated using the Speciated Modeled Attainment Test (SMAT) approach that utilizes a Federal Reference Method (FRM) mass construction methodology which results in reduced nitrates (relative to the amount measured by routine speciation networks), higher mass associated with sulfates (reflecting water included in FRM measurements), and a measure of organic carbonaceous mass that is derived from the difference between measured PM2.5 and its non-carbon components. This characterization of PM2.5 mass also reflects crustal material and other minor constituents. The resulting characterization provides a complete mass balance. It does not have any unknown mass that is sometimes presented as the difference between measured PM2.5 mass and the characterized chemical components derived from routine speciation measurements. However, the assumption that all mass difference is organic carbon has not been validated in many areas of the U.S. The SMAT methodology uses the following PM2.5 species components: sulfates, nitrates, ammonium, organic carbon mass, elemental carbon, crustal, water, and blank mass (a fixed value of 0.5 \u03bcg/m3). More complete details of the SMAT procedures can be found in the report \"Procedures for Estimating Future PM2.5 Values for the CAIR Final Rule by Application of the (Revised) Speciated Modeled Attainment Test (SMAT).\u201d (US EPA 2004) For this analysis, several datasets and techniques were updated.

Decisions about the emissions and other elements used in the air quality modeling were made early in the analytical process for the proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, the air quality analysis does not represent the proposal's regulatory scenario, nor does it reflect the expected impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Based on updated power sector modeling that incorporated expected generation mix impacts of the IRA (presented in Chapter 5), we are projecting the IRA will lead to a significantly cleaner power grid; because the air quality analysis presented here does not account for these impacts on EGU emissions, the location and magnitude of the changes in pollutant concentrations should be considered illustrative and not viewed as Agency projections of what we expect will be the total impact of the proposed standards. Nevertheless, the analysis provides some insights into potential air quality impacts associated with emissions increases and decreases from these multiple sectors. Given the considerable uncertainty associated with the upstream emissions inventory (see Chapter 8.2.2.5), we also modeled a sensitivity case that examined only the air quality impacts of the onroad emissions changes from the LMDV regulatory scenario. This \"onroad-only\" sensitivity case assumed no change in emissions from upstream sources and is based on the onroad emission inventories described in Chapter 8.2.1. In this section, we summarize the results of our illustrative air quality modeling based on the projected emission impacts of the LMDV regulatory scenario as well as the onroad-only sensitivity case. Air quality modeling was done for the future year 2055 when the program would be fully implemented and when most of the regulated fleet would have turned over. The \"reference\" scenario represents projected 2055 air quality without the illustrative regulatory scenario and the \"control\" scenario represents projected 2055 emissions with the illustrative LMDV regulatory scenario. As described in Chapter 8.2, the illustrative LMDV regulatory scenario assumes a light- and medium-duty fleet that phased-in to reach 50 percent BEV sales in 2030 and remained constant at 50 percent sales for model years 2030-2055 and a phase-in of gasoline particulate filters beginning in model year 2027."

                "content": " The illustrative air quality modeling analysis does not represent the proposal's regulatory scenario, and it does not account for the impacts of the IRA. In contrast, the OMEGA-based emissions analysis (see DRIA Chapter 9) does represent the specifics of the proposal and accounts for IRA provisions that affect the power sector. As a result, we used the OMEGA-based emissions analysis and benefit-per-ton (BPT) values to estimate the criteria pollutant (PM2.5) health benefits of the proposed standards. DRIA Chapter 7.4 describes the benefit-per-ton valuation methodology and DRIA Chapter 10 presents the PM2.5-related health benefits. Nevertheless, the illustrative air quality modeling analysis provides some useful insights into potential air quality impacts associated with emissions increases and decreases from multiple sectors, and it supports the conclusion that in 2055, the proposal would result in widespread decreases in ozone and PM2.5 that would lead to substantial improvements in public health and welfare. Using the illustrative air quality modeling results, we have quantified and monetized health impacts in 2055, representing the LMDV regulatory scenario described in DRIA Chapter 8.2. The approach we used to estimate health benefits is consistent with the approach described in the technical support document (TSD) that was published for the 2023 PM NAAQS Reconsideration Proposal (US EPA 2023). Table 8-15 reports the PM2.5- and ozone-attributable effects we quantified and those we did not quantify in this illustrative benefits analysis. The list of benefit categories not quantified is not exhaustive. The table below omits welfare effects such as acidification and nutrient enrichment.  Below we report the estimated number and economic value of reduced premature deaths and illnesses in 2055 attributable to the illustrative regulatory scenario along with the 95 percent confidence interval. Table 8-16 reports the number of reduced deaths and illnesses associated with reductions in PM2.5, along with their monetized economic value. Table 8-17 reports the number of reduced ozone-related deaths and illness, along with their monetized economic value. Table 8-18 reports total benefits associated with the illustrative regulatory scenario in 2055, reflecting alternative combinations of the economic value of PM2.5- and ozone-related premature deaths summed with the economic value of illnesses for each discount rate. In any complex analysis using estimated parameters and inputs from numerous models, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. The health benefits TSD that was published for the 2023 PM NAAQS Reconsideration Proposal details our approach to characterizing uncertainty in both quantitative and qualitative terms. That TSD describes the sources of uncertainty associated with key input parameters including emissions inventories, air quality data from models (with their associated parameters and inputs), population data, population estimates, health effect estimates from epidemiology studies, economic data for monetizing benefits, and assumptions regarding the future state of the country (i.e., regulations, technology, and human behavior). Each of these inputs is uncertain and affects the size and distribution of the estimated benefits. When the uncertainties from each stage of the analysis are compounded, even small uncertainties can have large effects on the total quantified benefits. "
