The increasing impact of carbon emissions from automobiles
on public health and climate necessitates accessible tools to
inform individuals and policymakers. This paper introduces
an AI-driven system called NEXUS that predicts tailpipe
emissions using carbon emission data from various cars and
contextualizes these predictions within the appropriate regulatory
framework. The system integrates a robust retrievalaugmented
generation (RAG) model, which retrieves relevant
regulatory information from government PDF documents and
combines it with emission predictions to generate informed,
context-aware responses. By providing tailored insights on
the climate effects of car-buying choices, the system aims
to raise public awareness about the environmental and health
consequences of carbon footprints. Furthermore, it offers actionable
intelligence to support policy decisions, promoting
sustainable practices and improving air quality. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate the systemâ€™s effectiveness in delivering
accurate, contextual, and actionable information, underscoring
its potential to drive both individual and collective
climate-conscious decision-making.
